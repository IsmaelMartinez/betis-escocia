feat: Implement GDPR option integration into user profile

This commit integrates the GDPR data access and deletion functionality into the user profile dashboard and refactors the unauthenticated user experience.

Key changes include:
- Moved Jest to Vitest migration documentation to historical archives.
- Created PRD and task list for GDPR user profile integration.
- Developed `GDPRTabContent` component and integrated it into `DashboardTabs`.
- Refactored `src/app/gdpr/page.tsx` for authenticated user redirection and unauthenticated message display.
- Updated `src/app/api/gdpr/route.ts` to enforce authentication and use user ID for data operations.
- Added unit tests for the GDPR API route.
- Modified the GDPR link in the footer (`src/components/Layout.tsx`) to dynamically route based on authentication status.
- Resolved all type-checking and linting errors.
- Updated comprehensive test coverage task list.
