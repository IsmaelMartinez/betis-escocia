# Ideas for Pe√±a B√©tica Escocesa Website

This document provides a list of ideas and features for the Pe√±a B√©tica Escocesa website. It serves as a brainstorming space for future enhancements and functionalities.

## üéØ **Core Feature Ideas**

### TV & Streaming Integration
* Find where it is shown on TV in the UK and Spain, maybe provide some links to the channels or streaming services.

### La Porra Enhancement
* Make the porra private only for Pe√±a members, so that we don't get in a legal trouble with the gambling commission. Also it is a skill based game, not gambling. 50/50 split of the prize pool, 50% to the winner, 50% to the Pe√±a (donation for the yearly celebration).

### AI Assistant
* Provide a cheap AI assistant for the users that access the website. It can guide them through the website, help them with the porra, and answer questions about Real Betis.

### Rumors Page (Soylenti)
* Add a soylenti (rumors in Turkish) page where rumors spread. Ceballos, again, is coming back to Betis, etc. It can be a fun page where people can share their opinions and rumors about the team. Fran mode to provide % values to the rumors.

### E-commerce Integration
* Implement merchandise management system to allow users to buy Pe√±a merchandise directly from the website.

### Voting System
* Implement a voting system for Pe√±a members to vote on various collection items (like t-shirts etc).

* Add email notifications for new RSVPs and orders

## üë• **User Features**

* Add user profiles with basic information

## üö© **Feature Flag Provider Migration**

### Goal
Evaluate moving from our current environment variable-based feature flags to a third-party feature flag provider.

### Requirements
- **Free tier available** for small-scale usage
- **Vercel integration preferred** but not mandatory
- **Easy migration** from current setup
- **Real-time flag updates** without deployment
- **A/B testing capabilities** for future use

### Potential Providers to Research
- **Vercel Feature Flags** (native integration)
- **LaunchDarkly** (industry standard)
- **Split.io** (comprehensive features)
- **Flagsmith** (open source option)
- **ConfigCat** (developer-friendly)
- **Unleash** (open source with hosted option)

### Benefits
- **Real-time updates**: Change flags without redeployment
- **User targeting**: Gradual rollouts and A/B testing
- **Analytics**: Feature usage tracking
- **Team collaboration**: Non-technical stakeholders can manage flags
- **Audit trail**: Track who changed what and when

### Implementation Considerations
- **Migration strategy**: Gradual transition from env vars
- **Fallback mechanism**: Ensure reliability during migration
- **Performance impact**: Minimize latency overhead
- **Integration complexity**: Assess development effort required
