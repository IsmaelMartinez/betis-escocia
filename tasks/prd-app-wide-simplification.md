# PRD: App-Wide Simplification and Code Complexity Reduction

## Introduction/Overview

The Betis Scotland app has grown organically over time, resulting in code complexity that makes it difficult to maintain and onboard new developers. This feature aims to comprehensively review and simplify all sections of the application to reduce technical debt, consolidate similar functionalities, improve developer experience, and optimize performance. The primary goal is to create a cleaner, more maintainable codebase that enables faster development velocity.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Code Complexity**: Eliminate technical debt and simplify overly complex implementations
2. **Consolidate Functionality**: Merge similar or redundant features and components
3. **Improve Developer Experience**: Make the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend
4. **Optimize Performance**: Streamline code to improve bundle size and runtime performance
5. **Standardize Patterns**: Establish consistent coding patterns and conventions throughout the app

## User Stories

- **As a developer**, I want to easily understand the codebase structure so that I can contribute effectively without extensive onboarding
- **As a maintainer**, I want simplified, consistent code patterns so that I can quickly locate and fix issues
- **As a new team member**, I want clear, well-organized code so that I can start contributing without getting lost in complexity
- **As a project lead**, I want reduced technical debt so that feature development can proceed faster with fewer bugs

9.2. Review and validate current feature flag implementation
9.3. Ensure all feature flag naming conventions are consistent
9.4. Verify all flags default to enabled unless explicitly disabled
9.5. Confirm removal of unused feature flag helper functions and wrappers
9.6. Final cleanup and optimization of feature flag system

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **UI/UX redesign**: This is focused on code simplification, not visual changes
- **New feature development**: No new functionality will be added during this process
- **Performance optimization beyond code simplification**: Advanced performance tuning is separate
- **Third-party service migrations**: Unless directly related to simplification (like the feature flags)
- **Data migration support**: All migrations have been completed; migration logic will be removed

## Design Considerations

- Maintain existing UI/UX appearance during simplification
- Preserve all current functionality while simplifying implementation
- Use TypeScript best practices for type safety
- Follow Next.js and React best practices
- Maintain responsive design patterns

## Technical Considerations

- **Dependencies**: Review and remove unused packages to reduce bundle size
- **TypeScript**: Ensure all simplifications maintain type safety
- **Testing**: Create simple happy path canary (UI flow) tests before each feature simplification to ensure no regressions
- **Test Strategy**: Use lightweight UI testing (e.g., React Testing Library) for key user flows
- **Migration Strategy**: Implement changes incrementally to avoid breaking changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure API contracts remain stable during refactoring

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Cleaner, more readable codebase**
   - Reduced cyclomatic complexity in key components
   - Decreased lines of code without functionality loss
   - Improved code maintainability index

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Test Setup (Critical Prerequisite)
- Setup canary test framework
- Configure testing environment
- Create test utilities and patterns

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical Priority)

### Phase 2: Core Systems
- Navigation and routing simplification
- API integration consolidation

- Final documentation updates

## Open Questions

1. **Testing Strategy**: Should we prioritize unit tests, integration tests, or both during simplification?
2. **Migration Timeline**: What's the acceptable timeframe for completing each phase?
3. **Breaking Changes**: Are there any areas where breaking changes would be acceptable for significant simplification gains?
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: What specific performance metrics should we track during simplification?
5. **Team Capacity**: How much development time can be allocated to this effort vs. new feature development?

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during simplification
  - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive testing and staged rollouts
- **Risk**: Developer resistance to new patterns
  - **Mitigation**: Provide clear documentation and migration guides
- **Risk**: Incomplete simplification due to time constraints
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize highest-impact areas and plan incremental improvements
