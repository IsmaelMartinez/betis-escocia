# Product Requirements Document: Feature Flag Auto-Refresh

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an auto-refresh mechanism for feature flags within the application. Currently, feature flag changes require a full page refresh to take effect, leading to a suboptimal user experience and delayed activation/deactivation of features. The goal of this feature is to enable dynamic activation and deactivation of features without requiring user intervention or a page refresh.

## 2. Goals

*   Enable dynamic activation and deactivation of features in the application.
*   Ensure feature flag changes are reflected in the UI without a full page refresh.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As an end-user**, I want new features or changes to existing features to appear automatically without me having to refresh the page, so that my experience is seamless and up-to-date.
*   **As an administrator/developer**, I want to enable or disable features in Flagsmith and see those changes reflected in the application quickly, so that I can manage feature rollouts and testing efficiently.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system must automatically check for updated feature flag values from Flagsmith.
2.  Upon detecting a change in feature flag values, the application's UI must update to reflect these changes without a full page reload.
3.  The auto-refresh mechanism should operate at a reasonable default interval, ensuring timely updates without excessive API calls.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This feature will not require a full application restart for flag changes to take effect.
*   This feature will not negatively impact server-side rendering (SSR) performance.
*   This feature will not introduce complex, custom state management solutions beyond what is necessary for Flagsmith integration.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   The implementation should leverage existing Flagsmith SDK capabilities for refreshing flags.
*   Consider if Flagsmith's SDK provides built-in real-time updates (e.g., via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events) that can be utilized for more immediate flag propagation. If not, a polling mechanism will be implemented with a configurable interval.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   The solution must integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js application architecture, supporting both client and server components where appropriate.
*   Prioritize using the Flagsmith SDK's native methods for refreshing flags (e.g., `flagsmith.getFlags()` or similar refresh functions).
*   Investigate if Flagsmith offers a real-time update mechanism (WebSockets/SSE) that can be integrated for instant flag updates. If not, a polling interval will be defined.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   Feature flags update in real-time (or near real-time) without a full page refresh, as observed by users and administrators.
*   No noticeable performance degradation or increased load times due to the auto-refresh mechanism.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What is the optimal default auto-refresh interval if a polling mechanism is used?
*   Are there any specific pages or components where auto-refresh is more critical than others?
*   Should there be an option for administrators to manually trigger a flag refresh from the UI (e.g., for immediate testing)?
