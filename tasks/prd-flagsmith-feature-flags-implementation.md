# PRD: Flagsmith Feature Flags Implementation

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of Flagsmith as the feature flag provider for the Peña Bética Escocesa website, replacing the current environment variable-based feature flag system. The implementation will enable real-time flag management, eliminate deployments for flag changes, improve team collaboration, and provide A/B testing capabilities for future use.

**Problem Statement**: The current environment variable-based feature flag system requires deployments for any flag changes, limits targeting capabilities, provides no analytics, and requires developer intervention for all flag management. This creates friction in feature rollouts and prevents non-technical team members from managing feature visibility.

**Goal**: Implement Flagsmith as a comprehensive feature flag solution that provides real-time flag management, user targeting capabilities, and sets the foundation for future A/B testing and experimentation.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Deployment Friction**: Enable real-time flag changes without requiring code deployments
2. **Improve Team Collaboration**: Allow developers to manage flags through a user-friendly dashboard
3. **Enable Advanced Targeting**: Support user-based and group-based feature targeting
4. **Establish A/B Testing Foundation**: Set up infrastructure for future experimentation capabilities
5. **Maintain System Reliability**: Ensure robust default value mechanisms and performance optimization
6. **Complete Migration**: Fully replace environment variable system with Flagsmith integration

## User Stories

### Primary Users (Developers)
- **US1**: As a developer, I want to toggle feature flags in real-time so that I can control feature visibility without deployments
- **US2**: As a developer, I want to target specific users or groups so that I can roll out features gradually

- **US4**: As a developer, I want reliable default value behavior so that the system remains stable if Flagsmith is unavailable
- **US5**: As a developer, I want clear documentation explaining the new Flagsmith system so that I can use it effectively
- **US6**: As a developer, I want updated code examples and implementation guides so that I can integrate features correctly

### System Requirements
- **US6**: As a system, I want to cache flag values locally so that performance remains optimal
- **US7**: As a system, I want to sync with Flagsmith in real-time so that flag changes are immediately effective
- **US8**: As a system, I want to handle network failures gracefully so that the application remains functional
- **US9**: As a system, I want to log flag evaluations so that debugging and monitoring are possible

- **Caching Layer**: Implement local caching with configurable TTL
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to default values
- **Performance**: Minimize bundle size and API calls

### Migration Strategy
- **Complete Migration**: Replace all environment variables in one implementation
- **New API Implementation**: Implement new Flagsmith-based API methods
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all flag combinations

### User Interface

## Technical Implementation Details

### Flagsmith Configuration
```javascript
// Example Flagsmith configuration
const flagsmithConfig = {
  environmentID: process.env.FLAGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT_ID,
  api: 'https://edge.api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/',
  cacheOptions: {
    ttl: 60000, // 1 minute cache
    skipAPI: false
  },
  enableLogs: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
};
```

### Flag Migration Map
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_CLASIFICACION` → `show-clasificacion`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_COLECCIONABLES` → `show-coleccionables`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_GALERIA` → `show-galeria`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_RSVP` → `show-rsvp`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_PARTIDOS` → `show-partidos`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SOCIAL_MEDIA` → `show-social-media`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_HISTORY` → `show-history`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_NOSOTROS` → `show-nosotros`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_UNETE` → `show-unete`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_CONTACTO` → `show-contacto`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_REDES_SOCIALES` → `show-redes-sociales`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_ADMIN` → `show-admin`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_CLERK_AUTH` → `show-clerk-auth`

### New Flagsmith API Interface
```typescript
// New Flagsmith-based API
import flagsmith from 'flagsmith';

// Flag evaluation methods
const showFeature = flagsmith.hasFeature('show-clasificacion');
const featureValue = flagsmith.getValue('show-clasificacion', false);

// Navigation filtering (updated implementation)
export function getEnabledNavigationItems(): NavigationItem[];
```

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **External Dependency**: Flagsmith service availability
- **Performance Impact**: Additional API calls and network latency
- **Migration Complexity**: Risk of breaking existing functionality
- **Caching Issues**: Stale flag values or cache invalidation problems

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Rely on default flag values configured within Flagsmith when the API is unavailable.
- **Local Caching**: Aggressive caching to minimize API calls
- **Gradual Testing**: Comprehensive testing before full deployment
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of flag performance and errors

### Rollback Plan
- In case of critical failure, a rollback will involve reverting the code changes from the feature branch and redeploying the previous stable version.

## Open Questions

1. **Caching Strategy**: What TTL should we use for flag caching to balance performance and freshness?
2. **User Identification**: Should we implement user-specific targeting immediately or in a future phase?
3. **Analytics Integration**: Should we integrate with existing analytics systems or rely on Flagsmith's analytics?
4. **Environment Sync**: How should we handle flag synchronization between dev/staging/prod environments?
5. **Performance Monitoring**: What metrics should we track to ensure optimal performance?
