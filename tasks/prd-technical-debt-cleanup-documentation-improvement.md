# PRD: Technical Debt Cleanup and Documentation Improvement

## Introduction/Overview

This initiative aims to comprehensively review and improve the Peña Bética Escocesa website project by removing technical debt, consolidating scattered documentation, and implementing better maintenance practices. The project has accumulated various documents, outdated files, and inconsistent documentation patterns that need to be addressed to improve maintainability and developer experience.

**Problem Solved:** The project currently has documentation scattered across multiple locations, outdated files in the tasks directory, inconsistent documentation patterns, and lacks proper Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key technical decisions that have been made.

**Goal:** Create a clean, well-documented, and maintainable codebase with consolidated documentation, proper ADRs for technical decisions, and improved project organization.

## Goals

1. **Remove Technical Debt**: Clean up outdated documents, unused files, and inconsistent code patterns
2. **Consolidate Documentation**: Create a single source of truth for project documentation
3. **Implement ADRs**: Document key technical decisions (Clerk auth, API choices, database selection) as Architecture Decision Records
4. **Improve Maintainability**: Establish consistent patterns and documentation standards
5. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are current and secure
6. **Standardize Processes**: Implement consistent development and documentation workflows

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want clear, up-to-date documentation so that I can understand the project structure and make informed decisions.

2. **As a project maintainer**, I want consolidated documentation so that I don't have to search through multiple files to find information.

3. **As a new team member**, I want to understand why key technical decisions were made so that I can contribute effectively.

4. **As a project stakeholder**, I want to see a clean, professional codebase that follows best practices and is easy to maintain.

5. **As a future developer**, I want to understand the historical context of technical decisions through proper ADRs.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Documentation Cleanup
1.1. The system must consolidate all relevant documentation into a clear hierarchy
1.2. The system must remove outdated and duplicate documentation files
1.3. The system must update the main README.md with current, accurate information
1.4. The system must standardize documentation format and style

### 2. Technical Debt Removal
2.1. The system must remove all files in the `tasks/old/` directory after review
2.2. The system must consolidate duplicate instruction files in `.github/instructions/`
2.3. The system must update or remove outdated API documentation
2.4. The system must review and clean up unused dependencies

### 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
3.1. The system must create ADRs for the Clerk authentication decision
3.2. The system must create ADRs for the Football-Data.org API choice
3.3. The system must create ADRs for the Supabase database selection
3.4. The system must establish an ADR template for future decisions

### 4. Documentation Structure
4.1. The system must create a clear `/docs` directory structure
4.2. The system must consolidate security documentation
4.3. The system must update API documentation to match current implementation
4.4. The system must create or update developer onboarding documentation

### 5. Code Quality
5.1. The system must review and update TypeScript configurations
5.2. The system must ensure all dependencies are up-to-date
5.3. The system must standardize code formatting and linting rules
5.4. The system must remove any unused code or components

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Feature Development**: No new features will be added during this cleanup
2. **UI/UX Changes**: No changes to user interface or user experience
3. **Database Migration**: No changes to current database implementation
4. **Authentication Changes**: No modifications to current Clerk implementation
5. **Performance Optimization**: Focus is on documentation and organization, not performance
6. **API Changes**: No modifications to existing API endpoints

## Design Considerations

### Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── adr/                    # Architecture Decision Records
│   ├── 001-clerk-auth.md
│   ├── 002-football-api.md
│   └── 003-supabase-db.md
├── api/                    # API documentation
├── security/               # Security documentation
├── development/            # Developer guides
└── deployment/             # Deployment guides
```

### ADR Template
- **Title**: Decision title
- **Status**: Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated

## Technical Considerations

### Current Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Clerk.com
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **External APIs**: Football-Data.org
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4

### Key Technical Decisions to Document
1. **Clerk Authentication**: Why chosen over alternatives, benefits, trade-offs
2. **Football-Data.org API**: Free tier limitations, alternatives considered
3. **Supabase Database**: Comparison with other options, GDPR compliance
4. **Feature Flags**: Secure-by-default implementation

### Dependencies to Review
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Update to latest stable versions
- Remove unused dependencies
- Verify compatibility with Next.js 15

## Success Metrics

### Documentation Quality
- **Completeness**: 100% of key technical decisions documented as ADRs
- **Accessibility**: Single README serves as effective entry point
- **Consistency**: All documentation follows same format and style
- **Accuracy**: All documentation reflects current implementation

### Technical Debt Reduction
- **File Cleanup**: 90% reduction in outdated/duplicate files
- **Code Quality**: Zero ESLint warnings or TypeScript errors
- **Dependency Health**: All dependencies current and secure
- **Structure**: Clear, logical organization of all project files

### Developer Experience
- **Onboarding Time**: New developers can set up project in <15 minutes
- **Decision Context**: Historical context available for all major decisions

## Open Questions

1. **ADR Location**: Should ADRs be in `/docs/adr/` or root-level `/adr/`?
2. **Legacy Content**: What should be done with historical PRDs in `tasks/old/`?
3. **Automation**: Should we implement automated checks for documentation quality?
4. **Versioning**: How should we handle versioning of ADRs and documentation?
