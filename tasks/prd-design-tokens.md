# Product Requirements Document: Design Tokens Implementation

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive design token system within the Betis project. The primary problem this initiative aims to solve is the current inconsistency in styling across the application. By establishing a single source of truth for design decisions, we will improve design-to-development handoff, enhance consistency, and lay the groundwork for future theming capabilities.

## 2. Goals

*   To eliminate styling inconsistencies across all components in the Betis application.
*   To establish a single, version-controlled source of truth for all design values (colors, typography, spacing, etc.).
*   To streamline the process of applying design changes, ensuring they propagate consistently and efficiently throughout the codebase.
*   To improve the collaboration and handoff between design and development teams.
*   To enhance the maintainability and scalability of the project's styling.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a developer**, I want to use named design tokens (e.g., `color-primary-500`, `spacing-md`) instead of hardcoded values (e.g., `#007bff`, `16px`) so that all components maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.
*   **As a designer**, I want to have a single source of truth for design values (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing) that is directly consumable by developers so that design changes are accurately and consistently reflected in the codebase.
*   **As a developer**, I want to easily update a design property (e.g., change the primary brand color) in one place so that the change propagates consistently across all components using that token.

## 4. Functional Requirements

The design token system must support and provide tokens for the following core functionalities:

1.  **Colors:** Define and manage a comprehensive color palette, including primary, secondary, success, error, neutral, and accent colors, reflecting the Betis (green and white) and Scottish blue heritage.
2.  **Typography:** Define and manage font families, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing for various text elements (e.g., headings, body text, captions).
3.  **Spacing:** Define and manage a consistent set of spacing values for padding, margins, and gaps between elements.
4.  **Breakpoints:** Define and manage responsive breakpoints for adapting layouts across different screen sizes.
5.  **Shadows/Elevation:** Define and manage consistent shadow styles for elements requiring elevation.
6.  **Border Radii:** Define and manage consistent border radius values for rounded corners.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   Full migration of an existing, external design system.
*   Implementation of a complex, dynamic theming engine beyond basic light/dark mode (initially).

## 6. Design Considerations

*   The design tokens should be derived from and align with the existing UI components, which currently embody the desired style (Betis colors: green and white, Scottish blue).
*   **Crucially, the implementation must address known contrast issues to ensure accessibility.** This will involve careful selection and testing of color combinations.
*   The design tokens should be visually documented within Storybook, providing clear examples and usage guidelines for both designers and developers.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   **Storage and Management:** Design tokens will be defined in structured JSON files, serving as the single source of truth.
*   **Integration with Tailwind CSS:** The JSON tokens will be integrated into `tailwind.config.mjs` to extend Tailwind's theme, allowing developers to consume tokens directly via Tailwind's utility classes.
*   **CSS Variable Generation (Optional but Recommended):** A process will be established to optionally generate CSS variables from the JSON tokens, providing flexibility for custom CSS and future theming.
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of all design tokens, including their values and usage examples, will be provided within Storybook (leveraging `docs/storybook/design-tokens.mdx`).
*   **Accessibility:** The token system must support and facilitate the implementation of accessible designs, particularly concerning color contrast.
*   **Dark Mode:** The token system should be designed to support a future dark mode implementation, allowing for easy switching of token values based on the theme.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   All new components developed after the implementation of design tokens will exclusively use the defined tokens for styling.
*   Existing components will be refactored to use design tokens, with a target of 100% adoption across the application.
*   Design changes (e.g., updating a brand color) can be implemented by modifying a single token definition and observing consistent propagation across the UI.
*   Accessibility audits show significant improvement in color contrast ratios.
*   Developers and designers report improved clarity and efficiency in styling-related tasks.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What is the preferred tool or method for transforming JSON tokens into Tailwind config extensions and CSS variables (if not handled manually)?
*   What is the exact process for auditing and addressing the existing contrast issues?
*   What is the timeline for refactoring existing components to use design tokens?
