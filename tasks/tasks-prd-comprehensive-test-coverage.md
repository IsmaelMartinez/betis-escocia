### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed in `tests/unit/` with directory structure mirroring `src/`
- Integration tests should be placed in `tests/integration/` organized by feature area
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npm test -- --testPathPattern=specific/test/file` for specific tests
- Target 90% coverage for API routes and core business logic, 80% for utilities
- Mock external dependencies (Clerk, Supabase, external APIs) in unit tests
- Use real test database for integration tests where appropriate

## Component Testing with Storybook

This project utilizes Storybook v9 with `@storybook/addon-vitest` for comprehensive component testing. Components are tested directly within their Storybook stories (`.stories.tsx` files) using "play functions". These functions simulate user interactions and assert component behavior, and are automatically run by Vitest.

**Key points for component testing:**
- **Location**: Tests are written directly within `.stories.tsx` files.
- **Method**: Use `play` functions to define test scenarios.
- **Tools**: Leverage `within` and `userEvent` from `storybook/test` for interactions and assertions.
- **Execution**: Tests are run automatically when Storybook is built or when `npm test` is executed (via Vitest integration).

  - [x] 1.2 Create tests for RSVP API route (`/api/rsvp`) covering user authentication, event management, and validation - **COMPLETED: Applied same pattern as contact tests with proper Clerk/Supabase mocking, covers all 3 HTTP methods (GET/POST/DELETE) with 16 comprehensive test scenarios**
  - [x] 1.3 Create tests for contact API route (`/api/contact`) including form submission, validation, and admin notifications - **COMPLETED: Fixed ES module import issues with Clerk, properly mocked Supabase query builders, resolved security function mocking conflicts**
  - [x] 1.4 Create tests for admin role management API (`/api/admin/roles`) covering role assignment and permission validation - **COMPLETED: Added comprehensive integration tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, including authentication, validation, and error handling. Resolved Jest configuration issues with Clerk and Next.js server components.**
  - [x] 1.5 Create tests for admin user management API (`/api/admin/users`) including user lookup and role management - **COMPLETED: Refactored API to use serverRoleUtils abstraction layer, updated all tests to mock serverRoleUtils instead of direct Clerk client, fixed NextResponse mocking issues, and ensured proper error handling. All 16 test scenarios now pass covering GET, PATCH, and DELETE endpoints with authentication, validation, and error cases.**
  - [x] 1.6 Create tests for Clerk webhook handler (`/api/webhooks/clerk`) covering user sync and data consistency - **COMPLETED: Created comprehensive integration tests for webhook processing including user.created, user.updated, and user.deleted events. Tests cover webhook verification, header validation, data linking/unlinking operations, and error scenarios. Properly mocked svix library, Next.js headers, and Supabase functions. All 11 test scenarios pass covering successful processing, missing data edge cases, and database error handling.**
  - [x] 1.7 Enhance existing standings API tests (`/api/standings`) to cover caching scenarios and error handling - **COMPLETED: Enhanced existing standings tests with comprehensive caching scenarios (fresh cache, stale cache, empty cache, cache retrieval failures, cache save failures) and extensive error handling (network errors, API rate limiting, timeouts, generic errors, non-Error exceptions). Added 11 comprehensive test scenarios covering all cache states and error conditions with proper NextResponse and external service mocking. All tests pass successfully.**
  - [x] 1.8 Create tests for admin contact submissions API (`/api/admin/contact-submissions`) - **COMPLETED: Created comprehensive integration tests with 15 test scenarios covering authentication/authorization (3 tests), request validation (4 tests), database operations (3 tests), error handling (3 tests), token integration (1 test), and status tracking (1 test). Tests cover Clerk authentication integration, admin role validation, status management, database operations, and error handling. All tests pass successfully with proper mocking patterns established.**
