### Middleware and Integration

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` with directory structure mirroring `src/`
- Integration tests should be placed in `tests/integration/` organized by feature area
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npm test -- --testPathPattern=specific/test/file` for specific tests
- Target 90% coverage for API routes and core business logic, 80% for utilities
- Mock external dependencies (Clerk, Supabase, external APIs) in unit tests
- Use real test database for integration tests where appropriate
