## Relevant Files

- `package.json` - To add `@sentry/nextjs` and other Sentry-related dependencies.
- `next.config.js` - To configure Sentry webpack plugin and source map uploads.
- `.env.local` - To store Sentry DSN and other environment-specific Sentry configurations.
- `sentry.client.config.ts` - New file for client-side Sentry initialization and configuration.
- `sentry.server.config.ts` - New file for server-side Sentry initialization and configuration.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` or `src/app/error.tsx` - To implement Sentry Error Boundaries for React components.
- `src/app/api/**/*.ts` - To ensure Sentry captures errors from Next.js API routes.
- `src/middleware.ts` - Potential for capturing request data or user context for Sentry.
- `src/lib/clerk.ts` or related Clerk integration files - To associate Sentry errors with authenticated Clerk user IDs.
- `.github/workflows/enhanced-deploy.yml` - To integrate Sentry release tracking and source map uploads into the CI/CD pipeline.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Sentry SDK Installation and Basic Configuration
  - [x] 1.1 Install `@sentry/nextjs` package.
  - [x] 1.2 Add Sentry DSN to `.env.local` for development, staging, and production environments.
  - [x] 1.3 Create `sentry.client.config.ts` and initialize Sentry for the client-side.
  - [x] 1.4 Create `sentry.server.config.ts` and initialize Sentry for the server-side.
  - [x] 1.5 Configure `next.config.js` to wrap with Sentry's webpack plugin.
- [ ] 2.0 Error Capture Implementation
  - [x] 2.1 Implement Sentry Error Boundaries in `src/app/layout.tsx` or `src/app/error.tsx` to catch React component errors.
  - [x] 2.2 Verify automatic capture of unhandled JavaScript exceptions from the frontend.
  - [x] 2.3 Verify automatic capture of unhandled exceptions from Next.js API routes (backend).
  - [x] 2.4 Configure Sentry to capture network request failures.
- [ ] 3.0 Contextual Data Enhancement
  - [ ] 3.1 Integrate Sentry with Clerk to associate errors with authenticated user IDs.
  - [ ] 3.2 Verify that browser, OS, and device information are automatically included with errors.
  - [ ] 3.3 Configure Sentry to include request details (URL, method, headers, sanitized body) for backend errors.
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement breadcrumbs to log user actions and system events leading up to an error.
- [ ] 4.0 Performance Monitoring Setup
  - [ ] 4.1 Configure Sentry to track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS).
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement custom transaction tracing for critical user flows (e.g., user login, form submissions).
- [ ] 5.0 Release Management Integration
  - [ ] 5.1 Configure Sentry to automatically tag errors with the current application version/release.
  - [ ] 5.2 Set up source map uploading to Sentry as part of the build process (e.g., in `next.config.js` and CI/CD).
  - [ ] 5.3 Configure Sentry to differentiate errors by environment (development, staging, production).
