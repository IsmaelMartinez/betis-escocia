## Relevant Files

- `.github/workflows/enhanced-deploy.yml` - New GitHub Actions workflow for enhanced CI/CD pipeline.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - New Dependabot configuration file for automated dependency updates.
- `package.json` - Will need updates to add automation dependencies and potentially new scripts for quality checks (e.g., `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run lighthouse:accessibility`).
- `README.md` - Will be updated with documentation about the new automation infrastructure.
- `eslint.config.mjs` - Existing ESLint configuration for code quality checks.
- `tsconfig.json` - Existing TypeScript configuration for type checking.
- `playwright.config.ts` - Existing Playwright configuration for E2E tests.
- `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` - Existing E2E test files that will be run in the CI/CD pipeline.
- `tests/unit/**/*.test.tsx` - Existing unit test files that will be run in the CI/CD pipeline.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (or similar root layout) - Potentially relevant for Lighthouse accessibility testing setup if it involves a local server.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
