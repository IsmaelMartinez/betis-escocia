## Relevant Files

- `.github/workflows/enhanced-deploy.yml` - New GitHub Actions workflow for enhanced CI/CD pipeline.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - New Dependabot configuration file for automated dependency updates.
- `package.json` - Will need updates to add automation dependencies and potentially new scripts for quality checks (e.g., `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run lighthouse:accessibility`).
- `README.md` - Will be updated with documentation about the new automation infrastructure.
- `eslint.config.mjs` - Existing ESLint configuration for code quality checks.
- `tsconfig.json` - Existing TypeScript configuration for type checking.
- `playwright.config.ts` - Existing Playwright configuration for E2E tests.
- `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` - Existing E2E test files that will be run in the CI/CD pipeline.
- `tests/unit/**/*.test.tsx` - Existing unit test files that will be run in the CI/CD pipeline.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (or similar root layout) - Potentially relevant for Lighthouse accessibility testing setup if it involves a local server.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Set up Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline
  - [ ] 1.1 Create `.github/workflows/enhanced-deploy.yml` with `quality-checks` job.
  - [ ] 1.2 Configure `quality-checks` job to run `npm run lint`.
  - [ ] 1.3 Configure `quality-checks` job to run `npm run type-check`.
  - [ ] 1.4 Configure `quality-checks` job to run `npm run test:e2e`.
  - [ ] 1.6 Configure `quality-checks` job to run `npm run lighthouse:accessibility`.
  - [ ] 1.7 Create `production-deployment` job in `enhanced-deploy.yml` dependent on `quality-checks`.
  - [ ] 1.8 Configure `production-deployment` job to run `npm run deploy:production` and `npm run health-check:production`.
  - [ ] 1.9 Ensure `package.json` contains necessary scripts for all quality checks and deployment commands.
- [ ] 2.0 Implement Security Automation
  - [ ] 2.1 Configure GitHub Dependabot by creating `.github/dependabot.yml`.
  - [ ] 2.2 Set up GitHub security advisories and alerts in repository settings.
  - [ ] 2.3 Configure automated security scanning within the CI/CD pipeline (if not covered by Dependabot).
- [ ] 3.0 Integrate and Test Automation Systems
  - [ ] 3.1 Perform integration testing of the enhanced CI/CD pipeline.
  - [ ] 3.2 Perform integration testing of the security automation (Dependabot, security scanning).
  - [ ] 3.3 Address any issues found during integration testing.
- [ ] 4.0 Document and Train on New Automation Tools
  - [ ] 4.1 Update `README.md` with documentation on the new CI/CD and security automation.
  - [ ] 4.2 Create runbooks for common operational tasks now handled by automation.
  - [ ] 4.3 Prepare and conduct team training on using and monitoring the new automation tools.
- [ ] 5.0 Verify Automation Infrastructure Against Success Metrics
  - [ ] 5.1 Measure manual tasks reduced to confirm 90% reduction.
  - [ ] 5.2 Measure production deployment time to confirm < 5 minutes.
  - [ ] 5.3 Track deployment success rate to confirm > 99%.
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify 100% security scan coverage weekly.
