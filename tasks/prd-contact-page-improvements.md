# Product Requirements Document: Contact Page Improvements

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the enhancements for the existing "Contacto" page. The primary goal is to improve the user experience by providing a more intuitive and efficient way for users to find relevant contact information and submit inquiries. This will be achieved by highlighting key contact options and pre-populating user data for authenticated users.

## 2. Goals

*   **Improve User Navigation:** Streamline the user experience for finding relevant contact information.
*   **Increase Form Submission Efficiency:** Reduce the effort required for authenticated users to submit inquiries by pre-populating their details.
*   **Enhance User Engagement:** Provide a more dynamic and user-friendly interface for contacting the Pe√±a.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a user,** I want to see a clear overview of contact options (highlights) so that I can quickly identify the most relevant way to get in touch.
*   **As a user,** when I click on a contact highlight, I want the page to smoothly scroll to the corresponding section of the contact form so that I can easily fill out my inquiry.
*   **As an authenticated user,** I want my name and email address to be pre-filled in the contact form so that I don't have to type them manually.
*   **As an authenticated user,** I want to be able to edit my pre-filled name and email address in the contact form so that I can submit inquiries on behalf of others or correct information.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Highlight Display:** The "Contacto" page must display a set of "highlights" at the top, representing different contact categories or purposes.
    *   These highlights will be determined by existing feature flags (e.g., `showRSVP`, `showPartidos`, `showAdmin`, `showContacto`).
    *   Only highlights corresponding to enabled feature flags will be displayed.
2.  **Scroll-to-Form Functionality:** When a user clicks on a highlight:
    *   The page must smoothly scroll down to the relevant section of the contact form.
    *   Each highlight must be associated with a specific section or field within the contact form.
3.  **User Data Pre-population:** If the user is authenticated:
    *   The "Name" field in the contact form must be pre-populated with the user's first name and last name (if available from Clerk).
    *   The "Email" field in the contact form must be pre-populated with the user's primary email address (from Clerk).
    *   The "Phone" field should *not* be pre-populated.
    *   Pre-populated fields must be editable by the user.
4.  **Form Interaction:** The existing contact form submission functionality must remain unchanged.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   Implementing new contact methods (e.g., live chat, phone calls).
*   Adding new fields to the contact form beyond pre-population.
*   Complex analytics or tracking specific to highlight clicks (beyond standard page views).
*   Any changes to the backend API for contact form submissions, other than potentially accepting a `userId` if not already handled.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   **Highlights UI:** The highlights should be visually distinct and appealing, possibly using cards or prominent buttons. They should be designed to clearly indicate their purpose and clickable nature.
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Implement smooth scrolling behavior for a pleasant user experience when navigating from highlights to the form.
*   **Pre-population Indication:** Clearly indicate to the user that fields have been pre-populated (e.g., a subtle background color, a small icon, or a message).

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   **Frontend:** The "Contacto" page (`src/app/contacto/page.tsx`) will need modifications.
*   **Feature Flag Integration:** Utilize `isFeatureEnabled` from `@/lib/featureFlags` to conditionally render highlights.
*   **Clerk Integration:** Use `useUser` from `@clerk/nextjs` to access authenticated user data for pre-population.
*   **Form Handling:** Integrate pre-population with the existing form state management.
*   **Scrolling:** Implement client-side JavaScript for smooth scrolling (e.g., `window.scrollTo` with `behavior: 'smooth'` or a library like `react-scroll`).

## 8. Success Metrics

*   **Increased Form Submissions:** Monitor the number of contact form submissions.
*   **Positive User Feedback:** Gather qualitative feedback on the ease of use of the contact page.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What specific text/icons should be used for each highlight? (e.g., "General Inquiry", "Match Day Questions", "Admin Support")
*   Are there any specific CSS classes or utility functions already available for smooth scrolling, or should a new implementation be added?
*   Should the highlights be collapsible/expandable (accordion-style) or simply scroll the user down? (Decision: Smooth scroll to form section for simplicity and directness).
