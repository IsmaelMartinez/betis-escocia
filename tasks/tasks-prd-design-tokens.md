### Notes

- Design tokens should be defined in a structured, hierarchical manner (e.g., `color.brand.primary.500`).
- Prioritize refactoring critical or frequently used components first.
- Ensure backward compatibility during refactoring to avoid breaking changes.
- Accessibility (especially color contrast) must be a primary consideration throughout the implementation and auditing phases.
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npm test -- --testPathPattern=specific/test/file` for specific tests.
