### Notes

- Design tokens should be defined in a structured, hierarchical manner (e.g., `color.brand.primary.500`).
- Prioritize refactoring critical or frequently used components first.
- Ensure backward compatibility during refactoring to avoid breaking changes.
- Accessibility (especially color contrast) must be a primary consideration throughout the implementation and auditing phases.
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npm test -- --testPathPattern=specific/test/file` for specific tests.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Define Design Tokens Structure and Values
  - [x] 1.1 Research and select a suitable design token structure (e.g., W3C Design Tokens Community Group specification).
  - [x] 1.2 Define the core color palette (Betis green, Scottish blue, neutrals, utility colors) in `src/styles/colors.json`.
  - [x] 1.3 Define typography tokens (font families, sizes, weights, line heights, letter spacing) in `src/styles/typography.json`.
  - [x] 1.4 Define spacing tokens for margins, paddings, and gaps in `src/styles/spacing.json`.
  - [x] 1.5 Define responsive breakpoints in `src/styles/breakpoints.json`.
  - [x] 1.6 Define shadow/elevation tokens in `src/styles/shadows.json`.
  - [x] 1.7 Define border radius tokens in `src/styles/border-radii.json`.
  - [x] 1.8 Consolidate all token definitions into a main `src/styles/tokens.json` file, referencing the individual token files.

- [x] 2.0 Integrate Design Tokens with Tailwind CSS
  - [x] 2.1 Configure `tailwind.config.mjs` to extend its theme with the defined color tokens from `src/styles/colors.json`.
  - [x] 2.2 Configure `tailwind.config.mjs` to extend its theme with typography tokens (font sizes, line heights, letter spacing).
  - [x] 2.3 Configure `tailwind.config.mjs` to extend its theme with spacing tokens.
  - [x] 2.4 Configure `tailwind.config.mjs` to extend its theme with breakpoint tokens.
  - [x] 2.5 Configure `tailwind.config.mjs` to extend its theme with shadow tokens.
  - [x] 2.6 Configure `tailwind.config.mjs` to extend its theme with border radius tokens.
  - [x] 2.7 Verify that Tailwind utility classes are correctly generated from the new tokens.

- [x] 3.0 Generate CSS Variables from Design Tokens (Optional but Recommended)
  - [x] 3.1 Research tools for generating CSS variables from JSON design tokens (e.g., Style Dictionary, custom script).
  - [x] 3.2 Implement a script or configure a tool to generate CSS variables from `src/styles/tokens.json`.
  - [x] 3.3 Integrate the generated CSS variables into `src/app/globals.css` for use in custom CSS or for components not using Tailwind.
  - [x] 3.4 Add a script to `package.json` to automate the CSS variable generation process.

- [x] 4.0 Document Design Tokens in Storybook
  - [x] 4.1 Update `docs/storybook/design-tokens.mdx` to visually document all defined color tokens, including their names, values, and usage examples.
  - [x] 4.2 Extend `docs/storybook/design-tokens.mdx` to document typography tokens with examples of headings, body text, etc.
  - [x] 4.3 Extend `docs/storybook/design-tokens.mdx` to document spacing tokens with visual representations.
  - [x] 4.4 Extend `docs/storybook/design-tokens.mdx` to document breakpoint tokens and their application.
  - [x] 4.5 Extend `docs/storybook/design-tokens.mdx` to document shadow and border radius tokens.
  - [x] 4.6 Ensure the Storybook documentation provides clear guidelines for developers and designers on how to use the new tokens.

- [ ] 5.0 Refactor Existing Components to Use Design Tokens
  - [ ] 5.1 Identify existing components that use hardcoded styling values (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.).
  - [ ] 5.2 Prioritize components for refactoring based on usage frequency and impact.
  - [ ] 5.3 Refactor component styles to use Tailwind utility classes generated from design tokens (e.g., `text-betis-green-500` instead of `text-[#00A651]`).
  - [ ] 5.4 For components using custom CSS, replace hardcoded values with generated CSS variables.
  - [ ] 5.5 Verify visual consistency of refactored components in Storybook and the application.

- [ ] 6.0 Implement Accessibility Audits and Fixes
  - [ ] 6.1 Conduct an initial accessibility audit (focusing on color contrast) of the current application.
  - [ ] 6.2 Use a color contrast checker tool to identify and document all instances of insufficient color contrast based on WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
  - [ ] 6.3 Adjust color token values in `src/styles/colors.json` as necessary to meet accessibility requirements, ensuring brand consistency.
  - [ ] 6.4 Re-audit the application to verify that color contrast issues have been resolved.
  - [ ] 6.5 Document the process and findings of the accessibility audit.

- [ ] 7.0 Testing and Verification
  - [ ] 7.1 Update existing unit and integration tests for components affected by styling refactoring.
  - [ ] 7.2 Conduct visual regression testing (e.g., using Chromatic or Playwright visual comparisons) to ensure no unintended visual changes.
  - [ ] 7.3 Manually test the application across different browsers and devices to confirm consistent styling.
  - [ ] 7.4 Verify that design changes (e.g., modifying a color token) propagate correctly throughout the application.
  - [ ] 7.5 Ensure all automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) pass after design token implementation and refactoring.
