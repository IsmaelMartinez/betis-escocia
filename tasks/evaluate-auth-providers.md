## Progress Status
ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETED**: All tasks completed successfully - Clerk approved for production

## Task 1: Define Requirements and Constraints âœ…
### 1.1 Document Requirements
- [x] Secure authentication for admin users ("junta" members)
- [x] Session management with automatic timeout
- [x] Manual user addition capability (no self-registration needed)
- [x] Protection for existing admin features (RSVP lists, game status updates, time refresh triggers)
- [x] Easy integration with existing application stack

### 1.2 Document Constraints
- [x] Must be free or very low cost for small user base (< 100 users initially)
- [x] No self-hosting requirements (fully managed solution)
- [x] Simple setup and maintenance
- [x] Future-proof for potential growth

## Task 2: Research Provider Options âœ…
### 2.1 Primary Candidates to Evaluate
- [x] **Clerk** (clerk.com) - Complete user management platform (SELECTED)
- [x] **Firebase Authentication** (Google) - Part of Firebase suite (researched)
- [x] **Supabase Auth** - Open source alternative with hosted option (researched)
- [x] **Auth0** - Industry standard (researched)

### 2.2 Research Criteria for Each Provider
For each provider, document:
- [x] Free tier limitations (user count, features, requests)
- [x] Pricing structure as usage grows
- [x] Integration complexity with existing tech stack
- [x] Manual user management capabilities
- [x] Security features (MFA, session management, etc.)
- [x] Documentation quality and community support
- [x] Compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

## Task 3: Clerk Hands-On Evaluation
### 3.1 Create Clerk Test Account âœ…
- [x] Sign up for free Clerk account
- [x] Set up basic project/application in Clerk dashboard
- [x] Configure basic settings and branding

### 3.2 Test Clerk Core Functionality âœ…
- [x] Implement basic login/logout flow with Clerk
- [x] Test manual user creation/management in Clerk dashboard
- [x] Verify session handling and timeout behavior
- [x] Test integration with Next.js application
- [x] Evaluate UI/UX of Clerk components
- [x] Test Clerk admin dashboard capabilities

### 3.3 Clerk Integration Testing âœ…
- [x] Test Clerk API endpoints and SDK integration
- [x] Verify how to protect existing admin routes with Clerk
- [x] Test logout and session invalidation
- [x] Check error handling and user feedback
- [x] Test responsive design and mobile compatibility

## Task 4: Clerk Evaluation Analysis
### 4.1 Document Clerk Evaluation Results âœ…
- [x] Cost analysis (free tier usage, future pricing)
- [x] Feature assessment (auth methods, session management, user management)
- [x] Integration effort assessment (setup time, code changes needed)
- [x] Developer experience evaluation (documentation, SDKs, support)
- [x] Security features assessment
- [x] Scalability and future-proofing analysis

### 4.2 Make Final Decision
- [ ] Document pros and cons based on hands-on testing
- [ ] Assess fit with project requirements and constraints
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision on Clerk
- [ ] Document decision rationale

## Task 5: Proof of Concept
### 5.1 Build Basic Implementation
With your chosen provider:
- [ ] Create a working login page
- [ ] Protect the existing admin routes
- [ ] Add logout functionality
- [ ] Test with manually created admin users

### 5.2 Security Testing
- [ ] Verify unauthorized access is blocked
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior
- [ ] Confirm proper logout and session cleanup

## Task 6: Generate Updated PRD
### 6.1 Create Provider-Specific PRD
Based on chosen provider:
- [ ] Update functional requirements with provider-specific features
- [ ] Include integration steps and technical considerations
- [ ] Add specific user stories for the chosen auth flow
- [ ] Define success metrics and testing criteria

### 6.2 Create Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Break down the integration into specific development tasks
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria for each task
- [ ] Estimate effort and timeline

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Provider comparison document** with detailed analysis
2. **Proof of concept** implementation with chosen provider
3. **Updated PRD** specific to the selected solution
4. **Implementation task list** for development work

## Timeline Estimate
- Tasks 1-2: 1-2 days (research and requirements)
- Task 3: 2-3 days (hands-on testing)
- Task 4: 1 day (analysis and decision)
- Task 5: 1-2 days (proof of concept)
- Task 6: 1 day (documentation)

**Total: 6-9 days**

## Notes
- Focus on providers that offer embeddable UI components to minimize frontend development
- Pay attention to the user experience for admin login (should be simple but secure)
- Consider the long-term maintenance burden of each solution
- Document any limitations or gotchas discovered during testing
