# Task List: Evaluate Third-Party User Management Providers

## Overview
Evaluate hosted third-party user management providers to secure the existing admin functionality page. Focus on free/low-cost solutions that don't require self-hosting and allow manual user addition.

## Relevant Files
- `/tasks/evaluate-auth-providers.md` - This task list document
- `/tasks/auth-requirements.md` - Comprehensive requirements document for auth provider evaluation
- `/tasks/auth-constraints.md` - Detailed constraints document with priority matrix and red flags

## Progress Status
ðŸ”„ **Current Task**: Task 2.1 - Primary Candidates to Evaluate

## Task 1: Define Requirements and Constraints
### 1.1 Document Requirements
- [x] Secure authentication for admin users ("junta" members)
- [x] Session management with automatic timeout
- [x] Manual user addition capability (no self-registration needed)
- [x] Protection for existing admin features (RSVP lists, game status updates, time refresh triggers)
- [x] Easy integration with existing application stack

### 1.2 Document Constraints
- [x] Must be free or very low cost for small user base (< 100 users initially)
- [x] No self-hosting requirements (fully managed solution)
- [x] Simple setup and maintenance
- [x] Future-proof for potential growth

## Task 2: Research Provider Options
### 2.1 Primary Candidates to Evaluate
- [ ] **Clerk** (clerk.com) - Complete user management platform
- [ ] **Firebase Authentication** (Google) - Part of Firebase suite
- [ ] **Supabase Auth** - Open source alternative with hosted option
- [ ] **Auth0** - Industry standard (check free tier limits)

### 2.2 Research Criteria for Each Provider
For each provider, document:
- [ ] Free tier limitations (user count, features, requests)
- [ ] Pricing structure as usage grows
- [ ] Integration complexity with existing tech stack
- [ ] Manual user management capabilities
- [ ] Security features (MFA, session management, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation quality and community support
- [ ] Compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

## Task 3: Hands-On Evaluation
### 3.1 Create Test Accounts
- [ ] Sign up for free accounts with top 1-2 providers
- [ ] Set up basic project/application in each

### 3.2 Test Core Functionality
For each provider:
- [ ] Implement basic login/logout flow
- [ ] Test manual user creation/management
- [ ] Verify session handling and timeout behavior
- [ ] Test integration with your current application architecture
- [ ] Evaluate UI/UX of provided components
- [ ] Test admin dashboard capabilities

### 3.3 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test API endpoints and SDK integration
- [ ] Verify how to protect existing admin routes
- [ ] Test logout and session invalidation
- [ ] Check error handling and user feedback

## Task 4: Comparative Analysis
### 4.1 Create Comparison Matrix
Create a spreadsheet/document comparing:
- [ ] Cost (free tier limits, paid pricing)
- [ ] Features (auth methods, session management, user management)
- [ ] Integration effort (setup time, code changes needed)
- [ ] Developer experience (documentation, SDKs, support)
- [ ] Security features
- [ ] Scalability and future-proofing

### 4.2 Identify Top Choice
- [ ] Score each provider based on your criteria
- [ ] Identify the best fit for your needs
- [ ] Document decision rationale

## Task 5: Proof of Concept
### 5.1 Build Basic Implementation
With your chosen provider:
- [ ] Create a working login page
- [ ] Protect the existing admin routes
- [ ] Add logout functionality
- [ ] Test with manually created admin users

### 5.2 Security Testing
- [ ] Verify unauthorized access is blocked
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior
- [ ] Confirm proper logout and session cleanup

## Task 6: Generate Updated PRD
### 6.1 Create Provider-Specific PRD
Based on chosen provider:
- [ ] Update functional requirements with provider-specific features
- [ ] Include integration steps and technical considerations
- [ ] Add specific user stories for the chosen auth flow
- [ ] Define success metrics and testing criteria

### 6.2 Create Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Break down the integration into specific development tasks
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria for each task
- [ ] Estimate effort and timeline

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Provider comparison document** with detailed analysis
2. **Proof of concept** implementation with chosen provider
3. **Updated PRD** specific to the selected solution
4. **Implementation task list** for development work

## Timeline Estimate
- Tasks 1-2: 1-2 days (research and requirements)
- Task 3: 2-3 days (hands-on testing)
- Task 4: 1 day (analysis and decision)
- Task 5: 1-2 days (proof of concept)
- Task 6: 1 day (documentation)

**Total: 6-9 days**

## Notes
- Focus on providers that offer embeddable UI components to minimize frontend development
- Pay attention to the user experience for admin login (should be simple but secure)
- Consider the long-term maintenance burden of each solution
- Document any limitations or gotchas discovered during testing
