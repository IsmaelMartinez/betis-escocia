# PRD: LaLiga Match Integration

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will integrate a free 3rd party sports API service to replace the current mock match data in the Peña Bética Escocesa website with real Real Betis match information. The integration will provide comprehensive match data including scores, fixtures, statistics, and detailed match information to keep our football enthusiast members informed and engaged.

**Problem Solved:** Currently, the `/partidos` page displays mock/static match data, which provides no real value to our members who want to stay updated with Real Betis performance across all competitions.

**Goal:** Implement a robust sports data integration that provides detailed, accurate Real Betis match information with comprehensive statistics and player data.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Replace mock data with real Real Betis match information from a reliable sports API
2. **Data Completeness:** Display match scores, upcoming fixtures, player ratings, and detailed statistics
3. **Competition Coverage:** Include all Real Betis matches regardless of competition (LaLiga, Copa del Rey, Champions League, Europa League, etc.)
4. **User Experience:** Provide detailed match pages with comprehensive statistics and player information
5. **Technical Reliability:** Implement caching and progressive enhancement for optimal performance
6. **Cost Efficiency:** Utilize free tier APIs with smart caching to minimize requests

## User Stories

1. **As a Peña member**, I want to see Real Betis' latest match results with scores and basic statistics so that I can stay updated on the team's performance.

2. **As a football enthusiast member**, I want to view detailed match statistics including player ratings, possession, shots, and key events so that I can analyze the team's performance in depth.

3. **As a Peña member**, I want to see upcoming Real Betis fixtures across all competitions so that I can plan to watch matches or attend Peña events.

4. **As a mobile user**, I want the match information to load quickly and work without JavaScript so that I can access it regardless of my connection quality.

5. **As a website visitor**, I want to click on individual matches to see comprehensive details including lineups, substitutions, and match events so that I can get the full match story.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Match Data Integration**
   1.1. The system must integrate with a free sports API (Football-Data.org recommended) to fetch Real Betis match data
   1.2. The system must display match results with final scores for completed matches
   1.3. The system must show upcoming fixtures with date, time, and opponent information
   1.4. The system must include matches from all competitions (LaLiga, Copa del Rey, Champions League, Europa League, etc.)

2. **Match Display Features**
   2.1. The system must replace the current mock data in `/partidos` page with real match data
   2.2. The system must display match status (scheduled, live, finished)
   2.3. The system must show home/away team information with logos
   2.4. The system must include match date and competition name

3. **Detailed Match Information**
   3.1. The system must provide clickable match cards that lead to detailed match pages
   3.2. Detailed pages must include player ratings and statistics
   3.3. Detailed pages must show match events (goals, cards, substitutions)
   3.4. Detailed pages must display team lineups and formations
   3.5. Detailed pages must include possession statistics, shots, and other key metrics

4. **Data Management**
   4.1. The system must implement data caching to minimize API requests
   4.2. The system must handle API rate limits gracefully
   4.3. The system must provide fallback data when API is unavailable
   4.4. The system must update match data manually when needed (admin trigger)

5. **Technical Implementation**
   5.1. The system must work on mobile devices with responsive design
   5.2. The system must function without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
   5.3. The system must cache API responses to improve performance
   5.4. The system must handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

6. **API Integration**
   6.1. The system must use free tier API limits efficiently
   6.2. The system must implement proper error handling for API failures
   6.3. The system must store API keys securely in environment variables
   6.4. The system must retry failed API requests with exponential backoff

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time live match updates** - Initial version will focus on pre/post match data
2. **Video highlights integration** - Will be considered for future iterations
3. **Push notifications** - Not included in this phase
4. **User-generated content** - Comments, ratings, or social features on matches
5. **Fantasy football features** - Team selection or player trading functionality
6. **Betting integration** - No odds or gambling-related features
7. **Historical data beyond current season** - Focus on recent and upcoming matches only
8. **Multi-language support** - English/Spanish only for now

## Design Considerations

1. **UI/UX Requirements:**
   - Maintain consistency with existing website design
   - Use current `MatchCard` component as base for enhanced match display
   - Implement loading states for API data fetching
   - Design detailed match pages with clear information hierarchy

2. **Component Structure:**
   - Enhance existing `MatchCard.tsx` component to handle real data
   - Create new `MatchDetail.tsx` component for detailed match pages
   - Add `LoadingSpinner.tsx` for better user experience during data loading

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure match cards work well on mobile devices
   - Make detailed match pages readable on small screens
   - Optimize table layouts for statistics display

## Technical Considerations

1. **API Integration:**
   - Use Football-Data.org API (free tier: 10 requests/minute, 10 requests/day for some endpoints)
   - Real Betis team ID: 559 in Football-Data API
   - Implement API service layer in `src/services/footballDataService.ts`

2. **Data Caching:**
   - Implement Next.js API routes for data fetching with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
   - Cache match data for 1 hour for live matches, 24 hours for completed matches
   - Store cached responses in Next.js data cache

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
   - Retry mechanism for failed requests
   - Fallback to mock data if real data unavailable

4. **Performance:**
   - Use Next.js Image component for team logos
   - Implement lazy loading for detailed match information
   - Minimize API calls through intelligent caching

5. **Environment Setup:**
   - Store API key in `.env.local`
   - Add API endpoints to `src/app/api/` directory
   - Implement TypeScript interfaces for API responses

## Success Metrics

1. **Technical Success:**
   - 99% uptime for match data display
   - Page load time under 2 seconds for match pages
   - Zero JavaScript errors related to API integration
   - API rate limits never exceeded

2. **User Engagement:**
   - Increase time spent on `/partidos` page by 50%
   - Reduce bounce rate on match-related pages
   - Positive user feedback on match information accuracy

3. **Data Quality:**
   - 100% accuracy of match scores and results
   - Match data updated within 1 hour of manual refresh trigger
   - Zero instances of incorrect or outdated match information

## Open Questions

1. **API Rate Limits:** How should we handle the 10 requests/minute limit during high traffic periods?
2. **Match History:** How many previous matches should we display by default?
3. **Competition Prioritization:** Should we prioritize certain competitions (LaLiga) over others in the display?
4. **Admin Interface:** Do we need an admin panel to manually trigger data updates?
5. **Backup API:** Should we implement a secondary API source as backup (API-Sports.com)?
6. **Data Persistence:** Should we store match data in a database for better performance and reliability?
