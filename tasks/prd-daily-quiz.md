# Product Requirements Document: Daily Quiz Feature

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new "Daily Quiz" feature to be implemented on the application's dashboard. The goal is to provide a simple, engaging daily interaction for registered users, encouraging them to return to the application regularly. The quiz will consist of a single multiple-choice question per day, with immediate feedback on the correct answer.

## 2. Goals

*   Increase daily user engagement and retention by providing fresh, interactive content.
*   Offer a simple, quick, and fun activity for registered users.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a **registered user**, I want to **see a new quiz question daily** on my dashboard, so I can **engage with the application regularly**.
*   As a **registered user**, I want to be able to **select one answer from multiple choices** for the daily quiz, so I can **participate easily**.
*   As a **registered user**, I want to **immediately see the correct answer** after submitting my response, so I can **learn and verify my knowledge**.
*   As a **registered user**, I want to be **prevented from answering the same daily quiz more than once**, so the **quiz remains fair and challenging**.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system must display a single daily quiz question on the registered user's dashboard homepage.
2.  Each daily quiz must present exactly three multiple-choice options.
3.  The system must allow registered users to select only one answer per quiz.
4.  Upon submission of an answer, the system must immediately display the correct answer to the user.
5.  The system must prevent a registered user from submitting more than one answer for the same daily quiz.
6.  If a user has already answered the daily quiz, subsequent visits on the same day should display their previous answer and the correct answer, without allowing re-submission.
7.  A new, unanswered quiz question must be available to registered users each day.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This feature will **not** include a point system or scoring for correct answers at this stage.
*   This feature will **not** include leaderboards or any public display of user performance.
*   This feature will **not** support complex question types (e.g., true/false, fill-in-the-blank, image-based questions).
*   There will be **no** dedicated admin interface for managing quiz questions; questions will be managed via a simple data file or hardcoded initially.
*   There will be **no** historical view of past quizzes for users.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   The daily quiz component should be integrated as a distinct, visually appealing card or section on the dashboard homepage.
*   The UI should adhere to the existing design system and styling conventions of the application (e.g., using existing UI components from `src/components/ui/` or following `src/lib/designSystem.ts`).
*   Quiz options should be clearly presented and easily selectable (e.g., using radio buttons).
*   Feedback mechanisms for displaying the correct answer after submission should be clear and immediate.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   **Data Storage:** New Supabase tables will likely be required to store quiz questions and user responses.
    *   `quizzes` table: `quiz_id`, `date`, `question_text`, `option_a`, `option_b`, `option_c`, `correct_option`.
    *   `user_quiz_responses` table: `user_id`, `quiz_id`, `submitted_answer`, `submission_timestamp`.
*   **Authentication:** Leverage the existing Clerk authentication for user identification (`user_id`).
*   **Daily Reset Logic:** A mechanism will be needed to determine the start of a new "quiz day" and present the appropriate question.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Monitor the percentage of registered users who interact with the daily quiz.
*   **Quiz Completion Rate:** Track the percentage of users who view the quiz and submit an answer.

## 9. Open Questions

*   How will the daily quiz questions be managed and updated? Will they be manually updated in code, fetched from a simple JSON file, or will a future admin interface be considered?
*   What specific time zone will be used to determine the "daily" reset of the quiz?
*   What is the desired behavior if there is no quiz question available for a given day? Should the component be hidden, or display a placeholder message?
