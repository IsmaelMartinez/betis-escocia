# Product Requirements Document: Playwright Canary Tests for Unauthenticated Pages

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a suite of Playwright-based canary tests. The primary goal is to quickly detect regressions and ensure the continued functionality of critical unauthenticated main pages after deployments. These tests will serve as an early warning system, providing rapid feedback to developers and operations teams about potential issues before they impact end-users.

## 2. Goals

*   Detect regressions on critical unauthenticated pages quickly.
*   Ensure the main user flows remain functional after deployments.
*   Provide early warnings for broken pages before users encounter them.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a developer**, I want automated canary tests to run as part of the CI/CD pipeline, so that I can get fast feedback on the health of unauthenticated main pages after my changes are deployed.
*   **As an operations engineer**, I want clear and timely alerts when critical unauthenticated pages are broken, so that I can quickly identify and respond to production issues.
*   **As an end-user**, I want the main pages of the application to always be functional and accessible, so that I can reliably use the application.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The test suite must include happy path tests for the following unauthenticated main pages:
    *   Home page (`/`)
    *   RSVP page (`/rsvp`)
    *   Standings page (`/clasificacion`)
    *   Matches page (`/partidos`)
    *   About Us page (`/nosotros`)
    *   Join Us page (`/unete`)
2.  For each tested page, the happy path must verify:
    *   The page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).
    *   Key elements (e.g., hero image, main headings, navigation bar) are visible.
    *   Basic navigation to other unauthenticated pages works as expected.
    *   No console errors or network failures occur during page load.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   Authenticated user flows will not be covered.
*   Complex user interactions (e.g., form submissions, dynamic content filtering) will not be tested.
*   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., pixel-perfect comparisons) is out of scope.
*   Performance testing (e.g., page load times, rendering performance) is not a goal for these canary tests.
*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond a single default browser) is not included.
*   Mobile responsiveness testing is not a goal.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   Playwright's default test runner and reporting should be utilized.
*   Tests should be integrated with GitHub Actions for automated execution within the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Tests should run headless by default for efficiency, with an option to run in headed mode for local debugging.
*   Test files should be organized in a dedicated directory (e.g., `e2e/` or `playwright/`).

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   The test environment should be configured to run Playwright tests reliably.
*   Module resolution and imports within the Playwright tests should align with the Next.js project structure.
*   Consider how to handle environment variables (e.g., base URL) within the Playwright configuration.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   Canary tests run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Tests provide clear pass/fail results.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What is the desired frequency for running these canary tests in CI/CD (e.g., on every push to main, nightly, hourly)?
*   What specific alerting mechanism should be triggered upon test failure (e.g., Slack notification, email)?
*   Should there be a dedicated test environment for these canary tests, or will they run against the deployed application?
