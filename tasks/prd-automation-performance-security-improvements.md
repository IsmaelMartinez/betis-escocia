## Introduction/Overview

This initiative aims to improve the Peña Bética Escocesa website's operational efficiency, performance, and security by implementing automated processes, optimizing API usage, enhancing documentation systems, and strengthening security measures. Based on the current Football-Data.org API limitations and project structure, this PRD focuses on practical improvements that align with our free-tier constraints.

**Problem Solved:** The project currently lacks automation for routine tasks, has suboptimal API usage patterns, needs enhanced security monitoring, and requires improved documentation maintenance processes.

**Goal:** Create a robust, secure, and highly performant system with automated workflows that reduce manual overhead while maintaining reliability within our free-tier API constraints.

## Goals

1. **Optimize API Usage**: Implement intelligent caching and scheduling to maximize value from Football-Data.org's 14,400 daily requests
2. **Automate Routine Tasks**: Reduce manual work through automated testing, deployment, and maintenance workflows
3. **Enhance Performance**: Improve application speed through strategic caching, optimization, and CDN usage
4. **Strengthen Security**: Implement automated security monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and access controls
5. **Improve Documentation**: Automate documentation updates, quality checks, and maintenance processes
6. **Enable Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging, alerting, and performance tracking

## User Stories

### As a System Administrator

1. I want automated match data synchronization so that the website always has current information without manual intervention
2. I want security vulnerability alerts so that I can address issues before they become problems
3. I want performance monitoring so that I can identify and resolve bottlenecks proactively

### As a Developer

1. I want automated testing and deployment so that I can focus on feature development instead of manual processes
2. I want comprehensive documentation that stays up-to-date automatically
3. I want clear error logging and monitoring so that I can debug issues quickly

### As an End User

1. I want fast page load times so that I can access information quickly
2. I want reliable data that's always current and accurate
3. I want a secure experience that protects my personal information

## Football-Data.org API Analysis

Based on our current implementation and ADR-002, here are the key constraints and opportunities:

### Free Tier Limitations

- **Rate Limit**: 10 requests/minute = 14,400 requests/day
- **Competitions**: La Liga (PD) and Champions League (CL) only
- **Seasons**: Current season (2025) and previous season (2024) only
- **Endpoints**: `/competitions/{id}/matches` (teams endpoint restricted)
- **Status Filters**: `status=SCHEDULED` hits rate limits, must filter manually

### Current Usage Patterns

- **Real-time requests**: Used for live match data and standings
- **Manual sync**: Admin-triggered bulk synchronization
- **No caching strategy**: Each request hits the API directly
- **Inefficient filtering**: Multiple API calls for simple data

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Calendar Import**: Import full season fixtures once, update scores periodically
2. **Intelligent Caching**: Cache static data (fixtures) vs dynamic data (scores)
3. **Batch Processing**: Sync multiple matches in single operations
4. **Scheduled Jobs**: Automate routine data updates during low-traffic periods

## Technical Implementation Details

### Calendar Import Strategy

```typescript
// Example implementation approach
interface CalendarImportJob {
  season: string;
  competition: string;
  importDate: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
}

class CalendarImportService {
  async importSeasonFixtures(season: string): Promise<void> {
    // Import all fixtures for season (one-time operation)
    // Store in database with external_id mapping
    // Mark as imported to avoid re-importing
  }
  
  async updateMatchResults(): Promise<void> {
    // Update only scores for finished matches
    // More efficient than full match import
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
// Cache hierarchy for different data types
const CACHE_DURATIONS = {
  MATCH_RESULTS: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours (never change)
  UPCOMING_FIXTURES: 6 * 60 * 60, // 6 hours (rarely change)
  LIVE_MATCHES: 5 * 60, // 5 minutes (frequently change)
  STANDINGS: 60 * 60, // 1 hour on match days
};
```

### Background Job System

```typescript
// Job scheduling for different operations
const SCHEDULED_JOBS = {
  DAILY_SYNC: '0 4 * * *', // 4 AM UTC daily
  MATCH_DAY_SYNC: '*/30 * * * *', // Every 30 minutes on match days
  WEEKLY_CALENDAR_CHECK: '0 2 * * 1', // 2 AM UTC every Monday
  MONTHLY_CLEANUP: '0 1 1 * *', // 1 AM UTC first day of month
};
```
