# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Test Coverage Implementation

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of comprehensive test coverage for the Betis supporters club website to improve code quality, reduce production bugs, enable safer refactoring, and meet quality standards. Currently, the project has only 5.38% test coverage, which poses significant risks for maintenance and feature development.

The primary goal is to establish robust testing practices that cover critical business logic, API routes, and core utilities while creating a foundation for future development with confidence.

## Goals

1. **Improve Code Quality**: Achieve 70% overall test coverage with 90% coverage for critical business logic
2. **Reduce Production Bugs**: Establish comprehensive testing to catch issues before deployment
3. **Enable Safe Refactoring**: Provide test safety net for code improvements and feature development
4. **Establish Testing Standards**: Create consistent testing patterns and best practices for the team
5. **Prioritize Critical Areas**: Focus on API routes, business logic, and core utilities first

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want comprehensive test coverage for API routes so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking existing functionality.

2. **As a developer**, I want well-tested business logic functions so that I can refactor and optimize code without fear of introducing bugs.

3. **As a team member**, I want clear testing patterns and examples so that I can write effective tests for new features.

4. **As a project maintainer**, I want automated test coverage reporting so that I can monitor and maintain code quality standards.

5. **As a developer**, I want reliable mocking strategies so that I can test components in isolation without external dependencies.

6. **As a new team member**, I want comprehensive test documentation so that I can understand the codebase and contribute effectively.

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: Critical Business Logic (Target: 90% coverage)

1. **API Route Testing**: The system must include comprehensive tests for all API routes including:
   - Authentication flows (`/api/admin/*`, `/api/webhooks/clerk`)
   - Business logic routes (`/api/trivia/*`, `/api/rsvp`, `/api/contact`)
   - Data retrieval routes (`/api/standings`, `/api/matches`)
   - Error handling and edge cases

2. **Supabase Function Testing**: The system must test all database interaction functions in `src/lib/supabase.ts` including:
   - CRUD operations for all entities
   - Error handling and validation
   - RLS (Row Level Security) scenarios
   - Data transformation functions

3. **Utility Function Testing**: The system must test all utility functions including:
   - Flagsmith feature flag functions (`src/lib/flagsmith/`)
   - Authentication utilities (`src/lib/adminApiProtection.ts`)
   - Date/time utilities and formatters
   - Validation and security functions

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Target: 80% coverage)

4. **Service Integration Testing**: The system must test integration points with:
   - External APIs (Football API, classification services)
   - Clerk authentication flows
   - Supabase database operations
   - Flagsmith feature flag responses

5. **Middleware Testing**: The system must test middleware functionality including:
   - Route protection and authentication
   - Security headers and CORS
   - Request/response transformations

### Phase 3: Foundation for Future Development

6. **Mock Strategy Implementation**: The system must implement consistent mocking for:
   - Clerk authentication (unit tests use mocks, integration tests use real staging)
   - Supabase database calls (separate test database for integration tests)
   - External API services (comprehensive MSW setup)
   - Flagsmith feature flags

7. **Test Infrastructure**: The system must establish:
   - Automated coverage reporting in CI/CD pipeline
   - Test data factories and fixtures
   - Shared test utilities and helpers
   - Clear testing patterns and examples

8. **Documentation**: The system must provide:
   - Testing guidelines and best practices
   - Mock strategy documentation
   - Test writing examples for common patterns
   - Coverage requirement guidelines

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **UI Component Testing**: React component testing will be addressed in the Storybook integration phase
2. **Performance Testing**: Performance benchmarking and load testing are reserved for v2
3. **Visual Regression Testing**: UI testing will be handled separately with Storybook
4. **Cross-Browser E2E Testing**: Current Playwright E2E tests are sufficient for now
5. **Test Infrastructure Migration**: Moving from Jest to Vitest is considered for v2

## Design Considerations

### Test Organization Structure
```

├── unit/
│   ├── api/               # API route unit tests
│   ├── lib/               # Utility function tests
│   └── services/          # Service layer tests
├── integration/

├── helpers/               # Shared test utilities
└── setup.ts              # Global test configuration
```

### Mock Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Mock all external dependencies (Clerk, Supabase, APIs)
- **Integration Tests**: Use test database and staging services where appropriate
- **Consistent Patterns**: Establish standard mocking patterns for each service type

### Coverage Targets
- **Critical Business Logic**: 90% (API routes, Supabase functions, authentication)
- **Utilities and Services**: 80% (flagsmith, validation, formatters)
- **Overall Project**: 70% (balanced coverage across all areas)

## Technical Considerations

### Current Jest Configuration
- **Keep Existing Setup**: Maintain current Jest configuration with optimizations
- **Enhanced Mocking**: Improve console output suppression and mock strategies
- **Coverage Reporting**: Configure detailed coverage reports with thresholds

### Database Testing Strategy
- **Test Database**: Use separate Supabase test project for integration tests
- **Data Isolation**: Implement test data cleanup and isolation patterns
- **RLS Testing**: Ensure Row Level Security policies are tested

### Mock Service Worker (MSW) Integration
- **API Mocking**: Implement MSW for external API mocking in integration tests
- **Consistent Responses**: Create reusable mock responses for common scenarios
- **Error Simulation**: Test error scenarios and edge cases

### CI/CD Integration
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Enforce minimum coverage requirements in CI
- **Failure Prevention**: Block merges if coverage drops below thresholds
- **Reporting**: Generate and publish coverage reports

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics (Phase 1)
1. **Coverage Percentage**: Achieve 70% overall coverage, 90% for critical business logic
2. **Test Count**: Establish baseline of 100+ meaningful test cases
3. **API Route Coverage**: 100% of API routes have basic happy path and error scenario tests

### Quality Metrics (Phase 2)
4. **Bug Reduction**: Monitor production bug reports related to tested areas
5. **Development Confidence**: Track developer surveys on refactoring confidence
6. **Code Review Speed**: Measure improvement in code review velocity

### Process Metrics (Phase 3)
7. **Test Writing Time**: Establish baseline for test development time
8. **CI Pipeline Success**: Monitor test failure rates and build stability
9. **Coverage Maintenance**: Track coverage maintenance over time

## Implementation Priority

- API routes testing (authentication, RSVP, trivia, contact)
- Core Supabase functions (user management, data operations)
- Authentication and security utilities

### Medium Priority (Following 2 weeks)
- External service integration tests
- Middleware and route protection testing
- Feature flag functionality testing

### Low Priority (Final 2 weeks)
- Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Performance optimization of test suite
- Documentation and developer guidelines

## Open Questions

1. **Test Database Setup**: Should we create a dedicated test Supabase project or use database transactions for isolation?

2. **External API Rate Limits**: How should we handle rate limits when testing external API integrations?

3. **Feature Flag Testing**: Should we test actual Flagsmith integration or focus on mock scenarios for unit tests?

4. **Coverage Enforcement**: Should we implement git hooks to prevent commits that reduce coverage?

5. **Test Data Management**: What strategy should we use for managing test data fixtures and factories?

6. **Parallel Test Execution**: Should we optimize for parallel test execution to improve CI performance?

7. **Integration Test Environment**: Do we need a dedicated staging environment for integration tests?
