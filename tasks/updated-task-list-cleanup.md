### 🚨 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: INCOMPLETE DATABASE MIGRATION**

**Current State Analysis (July 2025):**
Significant progress on database migration! **RSVP and Contact systems** are now fully migrated to Supabase. The following **core business systems** still require migration:

#### ✅ **Systems Successfully Migrated:**
1. **RSVP System** (`/api/rsvp`) - ✅ Fully migrated to Supabase with GDPR compliance
2. **Contact Forms** (`/api/contact`) - ✅ **NEWLY COMPLETED** - Migrated to Supabase with full functionality

#### 📝 **Core APIs Still Requiring Migration:**
1. **Orders System** (`/api/orders`) - Stores merchandise orders in `data/orders.json`  
2. **Merchandise Catalog** (`/api/merchandise`) - Product data in `data/merchandise.json`
3. **Voting System** (`/api/camiseta-voting`) - Voting data in `data/camiseta-voting.json`

#### 🔍 **Systems Under Evaluation:**
5. **Porra System** (`/api/porra`) - Predictions in `data/porra.json` - **DEFERRED FOR EVALUATION**

#### 🔍 **Impact Assessment:**
- **Data Persistence**: Core business data is stored locally and won't persist in production
- **Scalability**: File system approach doesn't scale and isn't production-ready
- **GDPR Compliance**: Missing auto-cleanup and data retention policies for core systems
- **Admin Dashboard**: Can't fully function without database backend for orders and merchandise
- **Backup & Recovery**: No database-level backup for critical business data

### 🧹 **FILES REQUIRING CLEANUP**

#### Files to Remove/Clean:
- `/scripts/migrate-rsvp-data.ts` - Remove after data migration confirmed
- Old JSON file handling utilities and imports
- Unused file system dependencies (`fs/promises`, `path`)
- Temporary development and testing files
- Old API error handling patterns

#### Files to Update:
- `README.md` - Update architecture documentation
- `src/app/api/rsvp/route.ts` - Already updated ✅
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Already updated ✅
- API documentation and comments
- Component prop types and error states

#### Files to Test:
- All RSVP form interactions
- Merchandise voting system
