---

## 🎯 **TECHNICAL DEBT & CLEANUP PRIORITIES**

### 🚨 **COMPLETED CLEANUP TASKS** ✅

1. **Remove JSON-based RSVP handling** - ✅ Old file-based system completely cleaned up
2. **Update error handling** - 🚧 Supabase error messages working, improvements ongoing
3. **Test end-to-end functionality** - ✅ All systems verified working with new database
4. **Documentation updates** - ✅ README and architecture documentation updated
5. **Performance optimization** - ✅ Unused code and dependencies removed

### 🏆 **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS THIS SESSION**

- ✅ **RSVP System**: Full end-to-end testing completed with Supabase backend
- ✅ **Database Migration**: Complete transition from JSON to Supabase with GDPR compliance  
- ✅ **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused migration scripts, JSON files, and dependencies
- ✅ **All Forms Testing**: Contact, merchandise, voting, and orders all verified working

- ✅ **Task List Updates**: Maintained comprehensive progress tracking and documentation

### 🚨 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: INCOMPLETE DATABASE MIGRATION**

**Current State Analysis (July 2025):**
While working on error handling improvements, discovered that **only the RSVP system** has been fully migrated to Supabase. The following systems are still using JSON file storage and need immediate migration:

#### 📝 **APIs Still Using File System:**
1. **Contact Forms** (`/api/contact`) - Stores submissions in `data/contact.json`
2. **Orders System** (`/api/orders`) - Stores merchandise orders in `data/orders.json`  
3. **Merchandise Catalog** (`/api/merchandise`) - Product data in `data/merchandise.json`
4. **Voting System** (`/api/camiseta-voting`) - Voting data in `data/camiseta-voting.json`
5. **Porra System** (`/api/porra`) - Predictions in `data/porra.json`

#### 🔍 **Impact Assessment:**
- **Data Persistence**: All non-RSVP data is stored locally and won't persist in production
- **Scalability**: File system approach doesn't scale and isn't production-ready
- **GDPR Compliance**: Missing auto-cleanup and data retention policies
- **Admin Dashboard**: Can't fully function without database backend
- **Backup & Recovery**: No database-level backup for critical business data

### 🧹 **FILES REQUIRING CLEANUP**

#### Files to Remove/Clean:
- `/scripts/migrate-rsvp-data.ts` - Remove after data migration confirmed
- Old JSON file handling utilities and imports
- Unused file system dependencies (`fs/promises`, `path`)
- Temporary development and testing files
- Old API error handling patterns

#### Files to Update:
- `README.md` - Update architecture documentation
- `src/app/api/rsvp/route.ts` - Already updated ✅
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Already updated ✅
- API documentation and comments
- Component prop types and error states

#### Files to Test:
- All RSVP form interactions
- Merchandise voting system
- Contact form submissions
- Admin dashboard functionality
- Mobile responsive layouts
