# Product Requirements Document: Reusable RSVP Component

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a reusable RSVP component. The primary goal is to allow for easier integration of RSVP functionality across various pages of the website, specifically the main page, partidos (matches) page, and the dedicated RSVP page. This component will enable end-users to interact with event attendance features seamlessly, reducing code duplication and standardizing the user experience.

## 2. Goals
*   To create a single, modular RSVP component that can be easily integrated into multiple pages (main, partidos, RSVP).
*   To enable end-users to view event details, indicate their attendance, update their RSVP status, and see the number of attendees.
*   To support both authenticated and anonymous RSVP submissions.
*   To improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy across the application.

## 3. User Stories
*   **As a user**, I want to easily RSVP for an event directly from the main page so that I don't have to navigate to a separate RSVP page.
*   **As a user**, I want to see my current RSVP status on the event page so that I know if I've already responded.
*   **As a user**, I want to see how many people are coming to the game (next as priority but ideally available for each game) so that I can gauge attendance.
*   **As a developer**, I want to integrate the RSVP component with minimal effort so that I can quickly add RSVP functionality to new pages.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1.  The component must display relevant event details (date, time, location).
2.  The component must allow users to indicate their attendance status (Yes, No, Maybe).
3.  The component must allow users to update their previously submitted RSVP status.
4.  The component must display the current count of attendees for a given event.
5.  The component must support RSVP submissions from both logged-in (authenticated) and anonymous users.
6.  The component must correctly display the user's current RSVP status if they are logged in and have previously responded.
7.  The component must be able to fetch and display the number of attendees for any given event ID.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
*   This component will not handle the creation or management of events.
*   This component will not display a detailed list of all individual attendees.
*   This component will not integrate with external calendar applications.
*   This component will not manage or display historical RSVP data beyond the current event status.

## 6. Design Considerations
*   The component's design should follow existing design patterns from the current RSVP page.
*   The component must align with the overall site's styling, utilizing Tailwind CSS for consistency.
*   The component should feature a compact and intuitive user interface.
*   The component must be responsive and function correctly across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## 7. Technical Considerations
*   The component will interact with the existing RSVP data storage mechanism.
*   The component must handle authentication status to differentiate between logged-in and anonymous users for RSVP submissions.
*   Appropriate API endpoints will be required to fetch event details, submit/update RSVP status, and retrieve attendee counts.
*   Error handling for network issues, invalid event IDs, and other edge cases must be implemented.

## 8. Success Metrics
*   The component can be successfully rendered and fully functional on the main page, partidos page, and RSVP page.
*   Users can successfully submit and update their RSVP status through the component.
*   The component accurately displays the current RSVP status for logged-in users.
*   The component accurately displays the attendee count for events.
*   The component is responsive and provides a consistent user experience across different devices.

## 9. Open Questions
*   What is the specific API endpoint structure for fetching attendee counts for a given event?
*   Are there any specific UI/UX requirements for anonymous RSVP submissions (e.g., requiring an email address)?
*   How should the component behave if an event has passed (e.g., disable RSVP, display a message)?
