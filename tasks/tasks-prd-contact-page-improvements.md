## Relevant Files

- `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` - Main component for the contact page, where all UI and form logic changes will be implemented.
- `src/lib/featureFlags.ts` - Contains the `isFeatureEnabled` function, crucial for conditionally rendering highlights based on feature flags.
- `src/lib/flagsmith/types.ts` - Defines `FlagsmithFeatureName`, which will be used for typing feature flags associated with highlights.
- `src/components/MessageComponent.tsx` - Used for displaying form submission status messages.
- `src/components/Field.tsx` - Provides the input fields for the contact form.
- `src/lib/formValidation.ts` - Handles the validation logic for the contact form.
- `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` - The backend API endpoint for contact form submissions. (No direct changes expected, but verify functionality).

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Prepare Contact Page for Enhancements
  - [x] 1.1 Review `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` to understand its current structure and identify areas for modification.
  - [x] 1.2 Ensure necessary imports (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useUser` from `@clerk/nextjs`, `isFeatureEnabled` from `@/lib/featureFlags`, `FlagsmithFeatureName` from `@/lib/flagsmith/types`) are present.
  - [x] 1.3 Add `"use client";` directive at the top of `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` if not already present.
- [ ] 2.0 Implement Contact Highlights Display
  - [ ] 2.1 Define the structure for contact highlights within `src/app/contacto/page.tsx`, including `id`, `name`, `description`, `icon`, `color`, and a `feature` property (of type `FlagsmithFeatureName | null`).
  - [ ] 2.2 Modify the rendering of highlights in `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` to conditionally display them based on `isFeatureEnabled(type.feature)` for highlights with an associated feature flag.
- [x] 3.0 Develop Scroll-to-Form Navigation
  - [x] 3.1 Add a `useRef` hook to the contact form section in `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` (e.g., `formRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)`).
  - [x] 3.2 Update the `handleTypeChange` function in `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` to smoothly scroll to the form section using `formRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` when a highlight is clicked.
  - [x] 3.3 Ensure the highlight buttons call `handleTypeChange` with the appropriate `type.id`.
- [x] 4.0 Integrate User Data Pre-population
  - [x] 4.1 Use the `useUser` hook from `@clerk/nextjs` in `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` to access authenticated user data.
  - [x] 4.2 Implement a `useEffect` hook in `src/app/contacto/page.tsx` to pre-populate the `name` and `email` fields of the form state (`formData`) with the authenticated user's `firstName`, `lastName`, and `emailAddresses[0]?.emailAddress`.
  - [x] 4.3 Ensure that the pre-populated `name` and `email` input fields remain editable by the user.
- [ ] 5.0 Conduct Testing and Refinement
  - [ ] 5.1 Manually test the display of contact highlights, verifying that only enabled features are shown.
  - [ ] 5.2 Manually test the scroll-to-form functionality for all highlights, ensuring smooth navigation.
  - [ ] 5.3 Test user data pre-population for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify that the contact form submission functionality still works correctly after all changes.
  - [ ] 5.5 Check the browser console for any new errors or warnings introduced by the changes.
