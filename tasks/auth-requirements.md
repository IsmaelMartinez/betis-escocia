# Authentication Requirements Document

## Project Context
- **Project**: Betis Pena Admin Security
- **Goal**: Secure existing admin functionality page with third-party auth provider
- **Current State**: Unsecured admin page with RSVP management, game status updates, and time refresh triggers

- **FR-1.1**: System must provide secure login mechanism for admin users
- **FR-1.2**: System must authenticate users against third-party provider
- **FR-1.3**: System must redirect unauthenticated users away from admin pages
- **FR-1.4**: System must support logout functionality

### FR-2: Session Management
- **FR-2.1**: System must maintain user sessions after successful authentication
- **FR-2.2**: System must automatically timeout inactive sessions
- **FR-2.3**: System must provide session renewal mechanism
- **FR-2.4**: System must invalidate sessions on logout

### FR-3: User Management
- **FR-3.1**: System must allow manual addition of admin users (no self-registration)
- **FR-3.2**: System must support user deactivation/removal
- **FR-3.3**: System must provide user status visibility (active/inactive)
- **FR-3.4**: System must support user profile updates

### FR-4: Route Protection
- **FR-4.1**: System must protect existing admin routes:
  - RSVP list management
  - Game status updates
  - Time refresh triggers
- **FR-4.2**: System must maintain existing admin functionality without changes
- **FR-4.3**: System must provide consistent user experience

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Cost
- **NFR-1.1**: Solution must be free for small user base (< 10 users initially)
- **NFR-1.2**: Solution must have predictable pricing as usage grows
- **NFR-1.3**: Solution must not require upfront payment or credit card for testing

### NFR-2: Hosting
- **NFR-2.1**: Solution must be fully managed (no self-hosting required)
- **NFR-2.2**: Solution must handle infrastructure, updates, and maintenance
- **NFR-2.3**: Solution must provide high availability and reliability

### NFR-3: Integration
- **NFR-3.1**: Solution must integrate easily with existing application stack
- **NFR-3.2**: Solution must provide clear documentation and SDKs
- **NFR-3.3**: Solution must require minimal code changes
- **NFR-3.4**: Solution must support modern web frameworks

### NFR-4: Security
- **NFR-4.1**: Solution must follow industry security best practices
- **NFR-4.2**: Solution must provide secure password handling
- **NFR-4.3**: Solution must support secure session management
- **NFR-4.4**: Solution must have compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR preferred)

### NFR-5: User Experience
- **NFR-5.1**: Solution must provide intuitive login interface
- **NFR-5.2**: Solution must maintain consistent branding capability
- **NFR-5.3**: Solution must provide clear error messages
- **NFR-5.4**: Solution must support responsive design

## Technical Constraints

### TC-1: No Self-Hosting
- No server infrastructure management
- No database setup or maintenance
- No SSL certificate management
- No backup and recovery management

### TC-2: Minimal Development Effort
- Prefer pre-built UI components
- Prefer SDK-based integration
- Prefer configuration over custom code
- Prefer plug-and-play solutions

### TC-3: Future Considerations
- Solution should scale with potential user growth
- Solution should support additional features (MFA, SSO) if needed later
- Solution should have good community and vendor support
- Solution should be stable and well-maintained

## Success Criteria
