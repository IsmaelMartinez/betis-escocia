This document provides a list of ideas and features for the Peña Bética Escocesa website. It serves as a brainstorming space for future enhancements and functionalities.

* Integrate with 3rd party services to get previous maches information like replays, values, scorers, etc. //maybe livescore or similar update (api). it might simplify and replace a few of the attributes
  
* Find where it is shown on tv in the UK and Spain, maybe provide some links to the channels or streaming services.

* Make the porra private only for Peña members, so that we don't get in a legal trouble with the gambling commission. Also it is a skill based game, not gambling. 50/50 split of the prize pool, 50% to the winner, 50% to the Peña (donation for the yearly celebration).

* add friendly games to the system, so that we can see the results of the friendly games as well.

* Provide a cheap AI assistant for the users that access the website. It can guide them through the website, help them with the porra, and answer questions about Real Betis.

* Add a soylenti (rummors in turkish) page where rummors spread. Ceballos, again, is coming back to Betis, etc. It can be a fun page where people can share their opinions and rumors about the team. Fran mode to provide % values to the rumors.

* British and Spanish version of the website.
