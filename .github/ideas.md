# Ideas for Pe√±a B√©tica Escocesa Website

This document provides a list of ideas and features for the Pe√±a B√©tica Escocesa website. It serves as a brainstorming space for future enhancements and functionalities.

## Ideas

* Find where it is shown on tv in the UK and Spain, maybe provide some links to the channels or streaming services.

* Make the porra private only for Pe√±a members, so that we don't get in a legal trouble with the gambling commission. Also it is a skill based game, not gambling. 50/50 split of the prize pool, 50% to the winner, 50% to the Pe√±a (donation for the yearly celebration).

* Provide a cheap AI assistant for the users that access the website. It can guide them through the website, help them with the porra, and answer questions about Real Betis.

* Add a soylenti (rummors in turkish) page where rummors spread. Ceballos, again, is coming back to Betis, etc. It can be a fun page where people can share their opinions and rumors about the team. Fran mode to provide % values to the rumors.

* Implement merchandise management system to allow users to buy Pe√±a merchandise directly from the website.

* Implement a voting system for Pe√±a members to vote on various collection items (like t-shirts etc).
