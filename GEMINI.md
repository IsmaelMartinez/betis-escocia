## Project Overview

Real Betis supporters club website in Edinburgh with mobile-first design, serving match viewing parties at Polwarth Tavern. Built on Next.js 15 with TypeScript, featuring secure-by-default architecture using feature flags.

**ðŸ“– For comprehensive project details, architecture decisions, and implementation guides, please refer to the workflow-specific instruction files in `.github/instructions/` and the detailed documentation in `docs/` directory.**

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

The Gemini CLI can be extended using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, which expose tools and resources to the CLI. This allows for interaction with external systems, custom scripts, and specialized workflows beyond the CLI's built-in features.

### Integration with Gemini CLI

MCP servers are configured in the `.gemini/settings.json` file. The CLI discovers and executes tools exposed by these servers, handling connection management, tool filtering, and conflict resolution.

### Recommended MCP Servers for this Project

Given the project's technology stack (Next.js/TypeScript, Supabase), the following types of MCP servers are recommended for extending functionality:

-   **Official Supabase MCP Server:**
    -   **Use Case:** Directly interact with your Supabase database, manage schema, and execute SQL queries securely from the CLI.
    -   **Configuration:** Requires installing the Supabase CLI and configuring the official Supabase MCP server. Refer to the Supabase documentation for detailed setup instructions (e.g., `supabase.com/blog/mcp-server`).

-   **Node.js/TypeScript MCP Server (for Clerk and Flagsmith):**
    -   **Use Case:** Ideal for extending functionality using existing Node.js/TypeScript utilities, interacting with Clerk for user management, or Flagsmith for feature flag control.
    -   **Example:** A custom server that wraps Clerk's or Flagsmith's SDKs to expose their functionalities as tools to the Gemini CLI.

-   **HTTP-based MCP Server:**
    -   **Use Case:** A general solution for integrating with any external service that exposes an HTTP API. This is common for microservices, third-party APIs, or custom backend services.
    -   **Example:** A server that acts as a proxy or wrapper for external APIs (e.g., a football API for match data, a payment gateway), exposing their functionalities as tools to the Gemini CLI.

These recommendations provide flexibility to extend the Gemini CLI's capabilities in ways that align with the project's existing technologies and potential future needs.

    *   **Review Note:** This feature is fully implemented and tested. The trivia pointing system has also been implemented. Future enhancements could include user progress tracking, leaderboards, and expanded question database.

### Setting up MCP Servers for Gemini CLI

To enable the Gemini CLI to interact with Supabase, Clerk, and Flagsmith, you need to configure and run their respective MCP servers. This involves setting up environment variables, configuring `.gemini/settings.json`, and potentially creating VSCode tasks for easy management.

#### 1. Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your shell or `.env` file where you run the Gemini CLI:

-   **Clerk MCP Server:**
    -   `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Your Clerk Secret Key (e.g., `sk_test_...`). This is crucial for the Clerk MCP server to authenticate with Clerk's backend.

-   **Flagsmith MCP Server:**
    -   `FLAGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT_ID`: Your Flagsmith Environment ID (e.g., `YOUR_FLAGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT_ID`). This allows the Flagsmith MCP server to fetch feature flags from your Flagsmith project.

-   **Supabase MCP Server:**
    -   `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: A Supabase Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions. This is used by the official Supabase MCP server to authenticate with your Supabase account.
    -   `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`: Your Supabase Project Reference ID. This scopes the Supabase MCP server to a specific project.

#### 2. Running the MCP Servers

##### a. Custom MCP Servers (Clerk and Flagsmith)

These servers are implemented within this project under the `mcp-servers/` directory. You need to compile and run them:

1.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp-servers/clerk-mcp && npm install && npx tsc
    cd mcp-servers/flagsmith-mcp && npm install && npx tsc
    ```
2.  **Run in Background:**
    ```bash
    npm run start-mcp-servers
    ```
    *Note: This command runs both custom MCP servers in the background. You can use `fg` to bring them to the foreground or `kill <PID>` to stop them.* The Clerk MCP server runs on port `3001` and the Flagsmith MCP server on port `3002` by default.

##### b. Official Supabase MCP Server

This server is run directly via `npx` by the Gemini CLI. You do not need to clone or run it separately. The configuration in `.gemini/settings.json` will handle its execution.

#### 3. `.gemini/settings.json` Configuration

Create or update the `.gemini/settings.json` file in your project's root directory (`.gemini/settings.json`) with the following content:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clerkMcp": {
      "httpUrl": "http://localhost:3001/mcp",
      "timeout": 30000,
      "trust": false
    },
    "flagsmithMcp": {
      "httpUrl": "http://localhost:3002/mcp",
      "timeout": 30000,
      "trust": false
    },
    "supabaseMcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--read-only",
        "--project-ref=${SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      },
      "timeout": 30000,
      "trust": false
    }
  }
}
```

*Note: The `${SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF}` and `${SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN}` placeholders will be replaced by the Gemini CLI with the actual environment variable values.* You can also hardcode these values directly if preferred, but using environment variables is recommended for security.

#### 4. VSCode Configuration (Optional)

To easily manage the custom MCP servers within VSCode, you can add tasks to your `.vscode/tasks.json` file. This allows you to start and stop them directly from VSCode's terminal.

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Start Clerk MCP Server",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cd mcp-servers/clerk-mcp && npm start",
      "isBackground": true,
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "group": "build",
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "Start Flagsmith MCP Server",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cd mcp-servers/flagsmith-mcp && npm start",
      "isBackground": true,
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "group": "build",
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To run these tasks, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Tasks: Run Task`, and select the desired server. You can also configure `tasks.json` to automatically terminate background tasks when VSCode closes.

With these steps, your Gemini CLI will be fully configured to leverage the Clerk, Flagsmith, and Supabase MCP servers, enhancing your development workflow.

## Potential Areas for Improvement/Expansion (as a Principal Software Developer would think):

This section outlines areas for future development and optimization. It's crucial to regularly review these points to assess progress and re-prioritize based on current project needs and completed work.

-   **Strategic Task Deferral:** When encountering unexpectedly complex or time-consuming tasks, consider deferring them to focus on more manageable tasks to maintain momentum and avoid getting stuck. This allows for a more agile approach to development.

1.  **Centralized State Management:** For more complex UIs, consider a state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, React Context API) if not already implicitly handled by Next.js/React Query patterns.
    *   **Review Note:** This remains a relevant consideration as UI complexity grows. No explicit solution has been implemented to deprecate this.
2.  **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** Review error boundaries (`src/app/error.tsx`, `src/app/global-error.tsx`, `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) and ensure comprehensive logging (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) is in place for production.
    *   **Review Note:** While error boundaries exist, comprehensive production logging and monitoring (e.g., integration with a service like Sentry) is an ongoing effort and remains a high priority.
3.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Image Optimization:** Ensure Next.js `Image` component is used effectively with proper `priority` and `sizes` for LCP.
    *   **Data Fetching:** Optimize Supabase queries, consider server-side caching strategies (Next.js `revalidate` options, SWR/React Query).
    *   **Bundle Size:** Analyze and reduce JavaScript bundle size.
    *   **Review Note:** Performance is an evergreen concern. Specific optimizations might have been made, but continuous monitoring and improvement are always necessary. This remains a high priority.
4.  **Scalability:**
    *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for public API routes to prevent abuse.
    *   **Database Indexing:** Ensure appropriate database indexes are in place for frequently queried columns in Supabase.
    *   **Review Note:** Rate limiting is critical for public APIs and may not be fully implemented. Database indexing is an ongoing task as new queries and data patterns emerge. Both remain high priority.
5.  **Developer Experience (DX):**
    *   **Code Generation:** Explore tools like `supabase gen types` for generating TypeScript types from the database schema to improve type safety and reduce manual work.
    *   **Storybook v9 Migration**: **COMPLETED** - Successfully migrated to Storybook v9.0.18 with performance improvements, package consolidation, and enhanced testing integration. See ADR-010 for details. Related PRDs and tasks moved to `docs/historical/completed-tasks` and `docs/historical/implemented-features`.
    *   **Review Note**: Storybook v9 migration has been completed, providing better performance and development experience. Focus can now shift to expanding component documentation and visual testing capabilities.
6.  **Testing Coverage:** While E2E and some unit tests exist, ensure critical business logic and UI interactions have sufficient test coverage.
    *   **Review Note:** Testing coverage is an ongoing process. This remains a high priority to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
7.  **CI/CD Enhancements:** Review `github/workflows/` for opportunities to add more automated checks (e.g., performance audits, security scans).
    *   **Review Note:** CI/CD pipelines can always be improved. Adding more automated checks is a continuous effort and remains a high priority for release quality.
8.  **User Engagement Features:** A "Betis & Scotland Trivia Challenge" game has been implemented to boost engagement. This involved:
    *   **Database Design:** New Supabase tables (`trivia_questions`, `trivia_answers`) for game-specific data with proper UUID relationships.
    *   **Game Mechanics:** 3-question trivia format with 15-second timer per question, immediate feedback, and percentage scoring.
    *   **Daily Gameplay Model:** "Once per day" messaging encourages regular engagement without enforcing strict limitations.
    *   **Frontend Components:** Game timer (`GameTimer.tsx`), trivia page (`src/app/trivia/page.tsx`) with results section.
    *   **Feature Flag Integration:** Controlled by `show-trivia-game` flag for safe rollout and testing.
    *   **API Endpoints:** RESTful endpoints for fetching questions and answers with proper error handling.
    *   **Review Note:** This feature is fully implemented and tested. The trivia pointing system has also been implemented. Future enhancements could include user progress tracking, leaderboards, and expanded question database.
9.  **Internationalization (i18n):** If the audience is global, consider implementing i18n for content.
    *   **Review Note:** This is a strategic decision based on target audience. If the project is currently focused on a single language, this might be a lower priority.

### Plan for Reviewing Improvement Areas:

Regularly revisit this section (e.g., quarterly or before major releases) to:
1.  **Assess Progress:** For each item, determine if work has been done, if it's complete, or if it's still in progress.
2.  **Re-prioritize:** Adjust the priority of each item based on current project goals, new insights, and resource availability.
3.  **Update Notes:** Add specific notes under each item detailing current status, recent efforts, or changes in priority.
4.  **Remove Completed Items:** Once an area is deemed sufficiently improved or completed, it can be removed from this list or moved to a "Completed Improvements" section for historical context.

## Pointers for Future Interactions:
- **Always check `src/lib/supabase.ts`** for database interaction patterns.
- **Look for existing UI components in `src/components/`** before creating new ones.
- **Consult `docs/adr/`** for architectural decisions.
- **For authentication, assume Clerk** unless otherwise specified.
- **For feature flags, assume Flagsmith.**
- **When proposing new features, consider how they integrate with Supabase, Clerk, and Flagsmith.
