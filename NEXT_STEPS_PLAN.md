# Next Steps Plan - Post E2E Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-12

**Context:** E2E tests now working in CI. Sprint 1 (security & maintenance) completed. Ready for quality improvements and maintenance automation in future sprints.

---

## ✅ Sprint 1: Security & Compliance - COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ All tasks completed on 2025-11-12

### Completed Tasks

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Fix GitHub Workflow Permissions (CodeQL Warnings)

**Priority:** Critical | **Effort:** 15 minutes | **Status:** ✅ DONE

**Resolved:** All 4 CodeQL security warnings by adding explicit least-privilege permissions to workflow jobs.

**Changes Made:**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added permissions to all 4 jobs:
  - `test`: `contents: read`, `checks: write`
  - `quality`: `contents: read`
  - `e2e`: `contents: read`, `actions: write`
  - `deploy`: `contents: read`, `deployments: write`

**Impact:** Security compliance achieved, follows GitHub Actions best practices.

---

#### ✅ Task 1.2: Add Scheduled Build (Keep Supabase DB Alive)

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 20 minutes | **Status:** ✅ DONE

**Implemented:** Weekly scheduled build workflow to prevent Supabase database pausing.

**Changes Made:**

- `.github/workflows/scheduled-build.yml` (new file)
  - Runs every Monday at 3 AM UTC
  - Full test suite + build execution
  - Manual trigger option via `workflow_dispatch`
  - Records database activity to prevent free-tier pause

**Impact:** Database reliability improved, prevents unexpected downtime.

---

#### ✅ Task 1.3: Update Investigation Report

**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 10 minutes | **Status:** ✅ DONE

**Updated:** `INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md` with Phase 1 completion status.

**Changes Made:**

- Added resolution section documenting 8 completed tasks
- Clear reference to this plan for next steps
- Maintains historical context of investigation

**Impact:** Documentation complete, clear tracking of progress.

---

## ✅ Sprint 2: Maintenance Automation - COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ All tasks completed on 2025-11-12

**Actual Time:** ~55 minutes

### Completed Tasks

#### ✅ Task 2.1: Add Pre-commit Hooks with Lefthook

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 25 minutes | **Status:** ✅ DONE

**Implemented:** Automated code quality checks before commits using Lefthook.

**Purpose:** Catch issues before they reach CI, improve developer experience.

**Changes Made:**

- Installed lefthook v2.0.3 as dev dependency
- Created `lefthook.yml` with parallel hook execution
- Configured pre-commit hooks:
  - ESLint with auto-fix for staged files
  - Prettier with auto-format for staged files
  - TypeScript type checking
- Added prepare script to package.json for automatic setup

**Impact:**

- ✅ Prevents commit of linting errors
- ✅ Auto-formats code on commit
- ✅ Reduces CI failures from simple issues
- ✅ Faster feedback loop for developers
- ✅ Parallel execution for speed (written in Go)

**Verified:** Pre-commit hooks executed successfully on first commit

---

#### ✅ Task 2.2: Update Deprecated npm Packages

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 30 minutes | **Status:** ✅ DONE

**Resolved:** All deprecation warnings from transitive dependencies.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
All deprecated packages (glob@7.2.3, rimraf@3.0.2, inflight@1.0.6) were transitive dependencies from Storybook's dependency chain.

**Changes Made:**

- Updated Storybook packages: 9.1.5 → 9.1.16
- Added npm overrides in package.json:
  - `glob`: 7.2.3 → 10.4.5 (deprecated v7 removed)
  - `rimraf`: 3.0.2 → 5.0.10 (deprecated v3 removed)
  - `inflight`: removed entirely (no longer needed)

**Results:**

- ✅ Zero deprecation warnings during npm install
- ✅ Removed 10 packages, changed 4 packages
- ✅ Zero vulnerabilities found

**Validation:**

- ✅ Linting passed
- ✅ Type checking passed
- ✅ All tests passed: 2485 passed | 3 skipped (2488 total)

**Impact:** Improved security, performance, and reduced technical debt

## 🚀 Sprint 3: CI/CD Enhancements (PLANNED)

**Status:** ⏳ Waiting for validation period (1-2 weeks)

**Estimated Time:** ~5 minutes

### Task 3.1: Make E2E Tests Blocking

**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 5 minutes

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Do NOT implement until all prerequisites are met.

**Prerequisites (Must All Be True):**

- ✅ E2E tests pass consistently for 1-2 weeks in CI
- ✅ All team members can run E2E tests locally
- ✅ No flaky tests observed in at least 10 consecutive runs
- ✅ Clerk password issue fully resolved
- ✅ Team consensus on making tests blocking

**Current State:**

```yaml
e2e:
  name: E2E Tests (Non-blocking)
  continue-on-error: true # ← E2E failures don't block merge
```

**Proposed Change:**

```yaml
e2e:
  name: E2E Tests (Required)
  # Remove: continue-on-error: true
```

**Implementation:**

1. Monitor E2E test success rate for 1-2 weeks
2. Track any failures in a spreadsheet/issue
3. Get team consensus via discussion/meeting
4. In .github/workflows/ci.yml, remove the continue-on-error: true line from the e2e job.
5. In the same e2e job, update the name from "E2E Tests (Non-blocking)" to "E2E Tests (Required)".

**Files to modify:**

- .github/workflows/ci.yml

**Success Metrics:**

- E2E tests must have >95% success rate over 2 weeks
- Zero false positives (failures due to test flakiness)
- All real failures must be due to actual code issues

## 📞 Questions for Team Discussion (Before Sprint 2)

1. **Pre-commit Hooks:**
   - Are we comfortable with auto-formatting on commit?
   - Should type-check run on every commit or just pre-push?
   - Do we want to allow skipping hooks with `LEFTHOOK=0`?

2. **Package Updates:**
   - Should we update `glob` and `rimraf`, or wait for dependency updates to resolve them?
   - Is there appetite to migrate from `rimraf` to native Node.js `fs.rm`?
   - What's our tolerance for potential breaking changes from major version bumps?

3. **E2E Test Strategy:**
   - What's our target for E2E test stability (95%? 98%? 100%)?
   - How long should the validation period be (1 week? 2 weeks? 1 month)?
   - Who monitors E2E test health and makes the call to enable blocking?
