# ADR-011: Design Tokens Implementation

## Status
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Authors**: AI Assistant
- **Decision Maker**: Development Team

## Context
The Betis project currently suffers from styling inconsistencies due to the use of hardcoded values across various components. This makes design changes difficult to propagate consistently, hinders collaboration between design and development, and impacts maintainability and scalability.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive design token system to establish a single source of truth for all design values (colors, typography, spacing, breakpoints, shadows, border radii). These tokens will be defined in structured JSON files and integrated with Tailwind CSS to ensure consistent styling across the application.

## Consequences
### Positive
- **Eliminates Styling Inconsistencies**: All components will use consistent design values.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Design decisions are centralized and version-controlled.
- **Streamlined Design Changes**: Updates to design properties propagate consistently and efficiently.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Better handoff between design and development teams.
- **Enhanced Maintainability & Scalability**: Easier to manage and scale the project's styling.
- **Accessibility Improvement**: Facilitates addressing known contrast issues through centralized color management.

### Negative
- **Initial Setup Effort**: Requires upfront work to define and integrate tokens.
- **Refactoring Existing Components**: Existing components will need to be refactored to use the new token system.

### Neutral
- **Integration with Tailwind CSS**: Leverages existing styling framework.
- **Optional CSS Variable Generation**: Provides flexibility for custom CSS.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Continuing with current approach**: Rejected due to persistent styling inconsistencies, difficult maintenance, and poor scalability.
- **Implementing a full external design system**: Rejected as it was out of scope and overkill for the initial needs.

## Implementation Notes
- Design tokens will be stored in structured JSON files (e.g., `src/styles/tokens.json`).
- Tailwind CSS will be configured to extend its theme using these JSON tokens.
- A process for generating CSS variables from JSON tokens will be explored for custom CSS needs.
- Comprehensive documentation of tokens will be provided within Storybook (`docs/storybook/design-tokens.mdx`).
- Accessibility audits, particularly for color contrast, will be a critical part of the implementation.
