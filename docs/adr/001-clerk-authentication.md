# ADR-001: Clerk Authentication Solution

## Status
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-01-16
- **Authors**: Development Team
- **Decision Maker**: Technical Lead

## Context
The Peña Bética Escocesa website needed an authentication solution for admin functionality. The requirements included:
- Admin panel access for managing RSVPs, contact forms, and user data
- Secure user management with minimal maintenance overhead
- Cost-effective solution for a small user base (< 10 admin users)
- Easy integration with existing Next.js application
- Industry-standard security practices

## Decision
We chose **Clerk.com** as our authentication provider for admin functionality.

## Consequences
### Positive
- **Zero cost**: Free tier supports up to 10,000 MAU, far exceeding our needs
- **Enterprise security**: SOC 2 Type II, CCPA, GDPR compliant
- **Rapid integration**: Complete implementation in 1.5 days with <400 lines of code
- **Excellent developer experience**: TypeScript support, comprehensive documentation
- **Future-proof**: Rich feature set including MFA, SSO, organizations
- **Minimal maintenance**: Fully managed SaaS solution

### Negative
- **Vendor dependency**: Reliance on third-party service
- **Advanced features**: Some features require paid tier (not needed currently)
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand Clerk-specific patterns

### Neutral
- **Standard protocols**: Uses industry standards, reducing vendor lock-in risk
- **Active development**: Regular updates and feature additions

## Alternatives Considered
### Option 1: NextAuth.js
- **Pros**: Open source, self-hosted, flexible
- **Cons**: Higher maintenance overhead, security responsibility, setup complexity
- **Reason for rejection**: Too much maintenance for small team

### Option 2: Auth0
- **Pros**: Enterprise-grade, comprehensive features
- **Cons**: More expensive, complex pricing, overkill for simple needs
- **Reason for rejection**: Cost and complexity not justified

### Option 3: Firebase Auth
- **Pros**: Google-backed, good integration with other services
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, less flexibility, different ecosystem
- **Reason for rejection**: Less suitable for Next.js applications

## Implementation Notes
- Authentication integrated via Clerk Next.js SDK
- Admin roles managed through Clerk dashboard metadata
- Feature flag controls authentication features: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_CLERK_AUTH`
- Middleware protects admin routes and API endpoints
- Error handling and user feedback implemented
