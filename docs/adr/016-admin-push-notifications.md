# ADR-016: Admin Push Notifications Implementation

## Status
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Date**: 2025-01-12
- **Updated**: 2025-01-14
- **Authors**: Claude Code
- **Decision Maker**: Development Team

## Context

The Real Betis supporters club website needed a way to notify admin users in real-time when new RSVP submissions or contact form messages are received. Admin users need to be able to respond quickly to community activity, especially for match viewing party RSVPs at Polwarth Tavern.

Key requirements:
- Real-time notifications for admin users only
- Notifications for RSVP submissions and contact form messages
- Background notifications (work even when dashboard is closed)
- User-controlled notification preferences with database persistence
- Browser compatibility across modern browsers
- Secure implementation following existing patterns
- Deduplication to prevent notification spam

## Decision

We implemented a comprehensive push notifications system with the following architecture:

### Core Components
1. **Service Worker Integration**: Full PWA service worker (`public/sw.js`) with background notification handling
2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Real-time notification delivery via SSE stream
3. **Notification Manager**: Client-side manager for coordinating notifications and connections
4. **Database-based User Preferences**: Supabase table for persistent notification settings
5. **Admin-only Access**: Role-based permissions using existing Clerk admin verification
6. **Deduplication System**: Multi-layered approach to prevent duplicate notifications

### Implementation Details
- **Service Worker**: Complete PWA service worker with push notification handling, offline support, and notification click management
- **Push Notification Utilities**: `src/lib/notifications/pushNotifications.ts` with Service Worker registration and push subscription management
- **Notification Manager**: `src/lib/notifications/notificationManager.ts` managing SSE connections, reconnection logic, and notification lifecycle
- **SSE API Endpoint**: `src/app/api/notifications/trigger/route.ts` providing real-time notification streaming
- **Admin Panel**: Enhanced `src/components/admin/SimpleNotificationPanel.tsx` with full status display
- **Database Schema**: `notification_preferences` table with RLS policies for user preference management
- **Global Notification Queue**: In-memory notification queue with automatic cleanup

### Architecture Decisions
- **SSE over WebSockets**: Server-Sent Events for simpler implementation and better browser compatibility
- **In-memory Queue**: Simple global notification queue with timestamp-based cleanup (10-minute retention)
- **Client-side Deduplication**: localStorage-based tracking of processed notifications with automatic cleanup
- **Background Operation**: Notifications work even when admin dashboard is closed via Service Worker
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation from push notifications to simple browser notifications
- **Database-first Approach**: User preferences stored in Supabase with authenticated access
- **Non-blocking Integration**: Notification failures don't impact core RSVP/contact functionality

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Background Notifications**: Work even when admin dashboard is closed via Service Worker
- **Real-time Delivery**: Immediate awareness of new community activity via SSE
- **Deduplication**: No duplicate notifications through multi-layered prevention system
- **User Control**: Admins can enable/disable notifications individually
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Robust SSE reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Secure Implementation**: Following existing authentication and RLS patterns
- **Browser Compatible**: Works across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Maintainable Code**: Well-structured utilities and components
- **Performance**: Non-blocking integration with existing workflows
- **Visual Status**: Comprehensive status display for troubleshooting

### Negative
- **HTTPS Requirement**: Push notifications require secure context (handled by localhost exception)
- **Browser Permission Dependency**: Users must grant notification permissions
- **Service Worker Complexity**: Additional background process management
- **Memory Usage**: In-memory notification queue (mitigated by automatic cleanup)
- **Database Storage**: Additional table and API endpoints to maintain

### Neutral
- **SSE Connection**: Requires active connection for real-time delivery
- **Testing Complexity**: Requires browser permission grants in E2E tests
- **User Education**: Admins need to understand how to enable notifications

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Flagsmith Feature Flag Control
- **Pros**: Centralized feature control, immediate global enable/disable
- **Cons**: Additional dependency, slower implementation, organization disabled
- **Reason for rejection**: Flagsmith organization was disabled, blocking development

### Option 2: Email-only Notifications
- **Pros**: Universal compatibility, no browser permissions needed
- **Cons**: Slower response time, requires email infrastructure, less immediate
- **Reason for rejection**: Real-time requirement for match viewing parties

### Option 3: WebSocket Real-time Updates
- **Pros**: Real-time updates, no notification permissions needed
- **Cons**: Complex infrastructure, requires persistent connections, browser-dependent
- **Reason for rejection**: More complex than needed for admin-only notifications

### Option 4: JSON File Storage for Preferences
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, no database changes
- **Cons**: No user authentication integration, file system dependency, not scalable
- **Reason for rejection**: Implemented as intermediate step, migrated to database for security

## Implementation Notes

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `public/sw.js` - Complete PWA service worker with push notification handling
- `src/lib/notifications/pushNotifications.ts` - Service Worker registration and push notification utilities
- `src/lib/notifications/notificationManager.ts` - SSE connection management and notification coordination
- `src/app/api/notifications/trigger/route.ts` - Server-Sent Events API endpoint for real-time notifications
- `src/lib/notifications/preferencesDb.ts` - Database preference management (existing)
- `src/components/admin/SimpleNotificationPanel.tsx` - Enhanced admin notification control panel
- `src/app/api/notifications/preferences/route.ts` - User preference API endpoints (existing)
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin dashboard integration with notification manager
- `src/app/api/rsvp/route.ts` - RSVP API updated to queue notifications
- `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` - Contact API updated to queue notifications

### Integration Points
- **RSVP Workflow**: API route queues notifications in global store for SSE pickup
- **Contact Workflow**: API route queues notifications in global store for SSE pickup
- **Admin Dashboard**: Initializes notification manager and SSE connection on load
- **Service Worker**: Handles notification display and click actions in background
- **Notification Panel**: Displays comprehensive status of all notification components

### Notification Flow
1. **Form Submission**: RSVP/Contact APIs queue notification with timestamp-based ID
2. **SSE Delivery**: Real-time streaming to connected admin clients via Server-Sent Events
3. **Client Processing**: Notification manager receives and deduplicates notifications
4. **Service Worker**: Triggers persistent notifications that work in background
5. **User Interaction**: Clicking notifications opens admin dashboard
6. **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of old notifications (server: 10min, client: 1hr)

### Deduplication Strategy
- **Server-side**: Timestamp-based filtering to send only new notifications per SSE connection
- **Client-side**: localStorage tracking of processed notifications with automatic cleanup
- **Reconnection**: SSE includes `lastSeen` parameter to resume from last processed notification
- **Global Cleanup**: Server removes notifications older than 10 minutes automatically

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Push notification utilities and preference management
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations  
- **E2E Tests**: Complete notification workflow with browser permissions
- **Manual Testing**: Background notification delivery verification
