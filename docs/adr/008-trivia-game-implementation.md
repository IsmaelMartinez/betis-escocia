## Title
Trivia Game Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
To enhance user engagement and provide an interactive experience, a trivia game feature is being introduced to the Peña Bética Escocesa website. This game will test users' knowledge of Real Betis and Scottish culture/history.

## Decision
The trivia game will be implemented as a new feature within the existing Next.js application. It will leverage Supabase for question and answer storage, and Flagsmith for feature flagging to control its visibility.

## Consequences

### Positive
*   Increased user engagement and time spent on the website.
*   Provides an entertaining and educational activity.
*   Reinforces the unique blend of Betis fandom and Scottish heritage.
*   Utilizes existing technology stack (Next.js, Supabase, Flagsmith), minimizing the introduction of new dependencies.

### Negative
*   Requires manual population of trivia questions, especially for highly specific Real Betis content.
*   Adds complexity to the application's data model and frontend logic.
*   Initial implementation does not include advanced features like leaderboards or user-specific scoring, which may be desired in the future.

### Neutral
*   The game will initially be accessible via a direct URL, with navigation integration to be considered in a later phase.
*   External trivia APIs were considered but deemed insufficient for Betis-specific content, though they may be used to supplement general knowledge questions in the future.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Using only external trivia APIs:** While convenient for general knowledge, no suitable free API was found for Real Betis-specific trivia. This would necessitate a hybrid approach or a custom question bank anyway.
*   **Using a different database solution:** Supabase is already established for other data, making it the most efficient choice for consistency and ease of integration.

## Future Considerations
*   Implementation of leaderboards and user-specific score tracking.
*   Integration of external trivia APIs for broader question categories.
*   Adding an admin interface for easier management and population of trivia questions.
*   Exploring more complex question types (e.g., image-based).
