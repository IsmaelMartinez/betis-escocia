# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the reorganization and consolidation of documentation files within the project.

## Actions Taken

### Storybook Documentation Consolidation (July 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-storybook-expansion.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-storybook-expansion.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-storybook-expansion.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-storybook-expansion.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-storybook-integration.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-storybook-integration.md`**

### Email System Decommissioning (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md`**

### Jest to Vitest Migration (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md`**

**Rationale**: These files document the planning and implementation of Storybook expansion and integration, which has been completed with the migration to Storybook v9 (ADR-010). Moving them to historical ensures that the `/tasks` directory remains focused on active development tasks while preserving valuable historical context.

### GDPR Integration (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md`**

### Admin Push Notifications Implementation (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-admin-push-notifications.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-admin-push-notifications.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-admin-push-notifications.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-admin-push-notifications.md`**

## Benefits
- **Reduced Clutter**: The `/tasks` directory now contains only active development tasks.
- **Clearer Focus**: Easier to identify current priorities.
- **Preserved History**: Important historical documentation is retained in a dedicated archive.

## Next Steps
- Continue to move completed PRDs and task lists to the `docs/historical/` directory as features are implemented.
- Regularly review and update this document to reflect ongoing documentation reorganization efforts.
