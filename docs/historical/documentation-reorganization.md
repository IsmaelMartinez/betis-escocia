# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the reorganization and consolidation of documentation files within the project.

## Actions Taken

### Storybook Documentation Consolidation (July 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-storybook-expansion.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-storybook-expansion.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-storybook-expansion.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-storybook-expansion.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-storybook-integration.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-storybook-integration.md`**

### Email System Decommissioning (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-decommission-email-notification-system.md`**

### Jest to Vitest Migration (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-jest-to-vitest-migration.md`**

**Rationale**: These files document the planning and implementation of Storybook expansion and integration, which has been completed with the migration to Storybook v9 (ADR-010). Moving them to historical ensures that the `/tasks` directory remains focused on active development tasks while preserving valuable historical context.

### GDPR Integration (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-gdpr-user-profile-integration.md`**

### Admin Push Notifications Implementation (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-admin-push-notifications.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-admin-push-notifications.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-admin-push-notifications.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-admin-push-notifications.md`**

### Documentation Simplification & Completed Features (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-simplify-security-layer.md` to `docs/historical/tasks-prd-simplify-security-layer.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-simplify-security-layer.md` to `docs/historical/prd-simplify-security-layer.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-simplify-date-utilities.md` to `docs/historical/tasks-prd-simplify-date-utilities.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-simplify-date-utilities.md` to `docs/historical/prd-simplify-date-utilities.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-flagsmith-optimization.md` to `docs/historical/tasks-prd-flagsmith-optimization.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-flagsmith-optimization.md` to `docs/historical/prd-flagsmith-optimization.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-comprehensive-test-coverage.md` to `docs/historical/tasks-prd-comprehensive-test-coverage.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-comprehensive-test-coverage.md` to `docs/historical/prd-comprehensive-test-coverage.md`**

**Rationale**: These features have been completed as evidenced by ADRs 014-018 and comprehensive test coverage implementation. Moving them to historical documentation keeps the active tasks directory focused on current development priorities.

### Flagsmith Removal & Feature Flag Simplification (August 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-remove-flagsmith-simplify-feature-flags.md` to `docs/historical/tasks-prd-remove-flagsmith-simplify-feature-flags.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-remove-flagsmith-simplify-feature-flags.md` to `docs/historical/prd-remove-flagsmith-simplify-feature-flags.md`**

**Rationale**: The Flagsmith external service has been completely removed and replaced with a simple environment variable-based feature flag system. All infrastructure cleanup, testing updates, and documentation have been completed. The migration maintains all existing functionality while simplifying the architecture and eliminating external dependencies.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Clutter**: The `/tasks` directory now contains only active development tasks.
- **Clearer Focus**: Easier to identify current priorities.
- **Preserved History**: Important historical documentation is retained in a dedicated archive.

### Branch Deployments & Testing Implementation (September 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-branch-deployments-testing.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-branch-deployments-testing.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-branch-deployments-testing.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-branch-deployments-testing.md`**

### Trivia System Simplification (September 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-trivia-system-simplification.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-trivia-system-simplification.md`**

**Rationale**: Branch deployment infrastructure has been successfully implemented with Vercel configuration and GitHub Actions workflows. Trivia system has been completely streamlined with 91% state variable reduction and 60% API endpoint consolidation while maintaining 100% functionality.

### Simplified Admin Notifications (September 2025)
- **Moved `tasks/tasks-prd-simplified-admin-notifications.md` to `docs/historical/completed-tasks/tasks-prd-simplified-admin-notifications.md`**
- **Moved `tasks/prd-simplified-admin-notifications.md` to `docs/historical/implemented-features/prd-simplified-admin-notifications.md`**

**Rationale**: OneSignal-based notification system has been implemented and tested. The system is fully functional but requires a custom domain for production use (Clerk limitation). Implementation is complete and ready for activation once domain is configured.

## Next Steps
- Continue to move completed PRDs and task lists to the `docs/historical/` directory as features are implemented.
- Regularly review and update this document to reflect ongoing documentation reorganization efforts.
