# Product Requirements Document: Expanding Storybook Coverage

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for significantly expanding the Storybook component library within the Betis project. The primary goal is to enhance component reusability, improve development efficiency, and provide comprehensive visual documentation for all key UI components. By doing so, we aim to streamline developer onboarding, facilitate visual regression testing, and enable faster, more isolated development of UI elements.

## 2. Goals

*   **Improve Developer Onboarding:** Provide a centralized, interactive reference for all UI components, making it easier for new and existing developers to understand and utilize them.
*   **Facilitate Visual Regression Testing & Design Consistency:** Ensure that all components are visually documented in Storybook, serving as a baseline for visual regression testing and promoting consistent design implementation across the application.
*   **Enable Faster Iteration & Isolated Development:** Allow developers to build, test, and iterate on UI components in isolation, independent of the main application, leading to more efficient workflows.
*   **Comprehensive Visual Documentation:** Create a complete and up-to-date catalog of all UI components, showcasing their various states, props, and interactions.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a Frontend Developer,** I want to see all available UI components in Storybook so that I can quickly find and reuse existing components without rebuilding them.
*   **As a Frontend Developer,** I want to interact with component props and states in Storybook so that I can understand their behavior and integrate them correctly into new features.
*   **As a Designer,** I want to view all UI components and their variations in Storybook so that I can ensure design consistency and provide accurate feedback on implementations.
*   **As a QA Tester,** I want to easily access and test different states and edge cases of UI components in Storybook so that I can identify visual bugs and accessibility issues early.

## 4. Functional Requirements

The expanded Storybook implementation must:

1.  **Include Stories for All Applicable UI Components:** Every reusable UI component within `src/components` should have a corresponding Storybook story.
2.  **Demonstrate Different Component States:** Each component's stories must cover its various states (e.g., default, loading, error, empty, active, disabled).
3.  **Provide Interactive Controls:** Stories must utilize Storybook's `args` and `argTypes` to enable interactive manipulation of component props.
4.  **Showcase Accessibility Features:** Where applicable, stories should demonstrate the accessibility considerations and features of components.
5.  **Integrate Data Mocking Strategies:** Components requiring data should use consistent and effective data mocking strategies to ensure isolated and predictable rendering.
6.  **Support Performance Benchmarking (Optional but Desired):** Explore and integrate methods for basic performance benchmarking of components within Storybook, if feasible.
7.  **Adhere to Existing Storybook Conventions:** All new stories must follow the established conventions outlined in `docs/storybook-guide.md` (e.g., file naming, organization, `autodocs`).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This PRD does not cover the creation of new UI components; it focuses solely on documenting existing ones.
*   This PRD does not cover the implementation of new Storybook addons beyond what is already configured, unless explicitly required for a functional requirement.
*   This PRD does not cover the full end-to-end testing of application flows within Storybook (this is handled by Playwright).

## 6. Design Considerations

*   All new stories should align with the project's existing design system and branding guidelines.
*   Components should be presented in a clean and consistent manner within Storybook, utilizing appropriate layouts and backgrounds.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   New `.stories.tsx` files will be created alongside their respective component files in `src/components/`.
*   Mocking strategies for external dependencies (e.g., Supabase data, Flagsmith, Clerk authentication) will be crucial to ensure components can be rendered in isolation without relying on live services.
*   Leverage `Meta` and `StoryObj` types for defining stories, ensuring type safety and consistency.
*   Consider using Storybook decorators for common contexts (e.g., router context, theme providers) if components require them.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   **High Story Coverage:** Achieve a significant increase in the percentage of `src/components` files that have corresponding Storybook stories.
*   **Consistent Story Creation:** New UI components developed in the future consistently include Storybook stories as part of their definition of done.
*   **Increased Storybook Usage:** Evidence of increased active usage of Storybook by frontend developers and designers as a primary reference and development tool.
*   **Reduced UI-Related Bugs:** A measurable decrease in UI-related bugs reported in QA or production, attributed to improved isolated testing and visual verification via Storybook.
*   **Positive Team Feedback:** Positive feedback from development and design teams regarding the utility and completeness of the Storybook documentation.

## 9. Open Questions

*   Are there any specific components that should be prioritized first, beyond a general "all applicable" approach?
*   Should we establish a formal process for reviewing new Storybook stories to ensure quality and consistency?
*   What is the preferred method for mocking complex data structures for components that rely heavily on API responses?
