# PRD: Clerk Authentication Integration for Peña Bética

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the integration of Clerk authentication into the Peña Bética Escocesa website to provide user management capabilities while maintaining the existing anonymous submission functionality. The feature will introduce two user roles (admin and regular user) with different access levels, all protected behind a feature flag for controlled rollout.

**Problem Statement**: Currently, users can submit RSVPs and contact forms anonymously, but there's no way for them to view or manage their submissions. Admins need better user management capabilities, and users would benefit from having a personal dashboard to track their engagement with the peña.

**Goal**: Implement a secure, user-friendly authentication system that enhances the user experience without disrupting existing functionality.

## Goals

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Allow users to view their submission history and manage their profile
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement admin and regular user roles with appropriate permissions
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing anonymous submission functionality
4. **Secure Admin Access**: Protect admin features behind proper authentication
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy safely using feature flags for controlled testing
6. **Data Association**: Automatically link submissions to users based on email addresses

## User Stories

### Regular Users
- **US1**: As a regular user, I want to sign up with email/password so that I can access my personal dashboard
- **US2**: As a regular user, I want to sign in using social providers (Google, Facebook) for convenience
- **US3**: As a regular user, I want to view my RSVP history so that I can track my event attendance
- **US4**: As a regular user, I want to view my contact messages so that I can see what I've submitted
- **US5**: As a regular user, I want to access authentication through navigation links or auto-redirect when needed
- **US6**: As a regular user, I want to submit RSVPs and contact forms without authentication if I prefer

### Admin Users
- **US7**: As an admin, I want to access the existing admin dashboard with my authenticated account
- **US8**: As an admin, I want to manage user roles through Clerk's dashboard
- **US9**: As an admin, I want to maintain all current admin functionality without disruption
- **US10**: As an admin, I want to be the only one with access during initial testing

### System Requirements
- **US11**: As a developer, I want the feature behind a flag so it can be tested safely
- **US12**: As a developer, I want existing anonymous functionality to remain unchanged
- **US13**: As a developer, I want automatic email-based data association for user submissions

## Design Considerations

### User Interface
- **Navigation**: Add sign-in/sign-up buttons to main navigation when feature is enabled
- **Dashboard**: Create a clean, mobile-first user dashboard matching existing design patterns
- **Authentication Pages**: Use Clerk's customizable components styled to match Betis branding
- **Admin Integration**: Seamlessly integrate authentication into existing admin page

### User Experience
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Authentication enhances but doesn't replace existing functionality
- **Mobile-First**: All authentication flows must work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Follow existing accessibility patterns and WCAG guidelines

## Admin Role Management Guide

### Setting Up Admin Roles in Clerk

1. **Access Clerk Dashboard**
   - Log into your Clerk dashboard at https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Select your Peña Bética project

2. **User Management**
   - Navigate to "Users" section
   - Find the user you want to make an admin
   - Click on the user to view their profile

3. **Assign Admin Role**
   - In the user profile, go to "Metadata" tab
   - Add a new metadata field:
     - **Key**: `role`
     - **Value**: `admin`
   - Save the changes

4. **Verify Role Assignment**
   - The user will now have admin access on next login
   - Check the admin dashboard to confirm access

### Alternative Method: Using Clerk's Organizations (If Needed Later)
- Create an "Admin" organization
- Invite users to the organization with admin permissions
- Use organization membership for role validation

## Open Questions

1. **Q1**: Should we implement email verification for new user registrations?
2. **Q2**: Do we need password reset functionality beyond Clerk's default?
3. **Q3**: Should we add any custom user profile fields specific to peña members?
4. **Q4**: Do we need to implement user activity logging for admin monitoring?
5. **Q5**: Should we consider implementing user deletion/deactivation features?

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Setup**: Configure Clerk authentication components
2. **Database Updates**: Extend schema for user association
3. **UI Development**: Create user dashboard and integrate authentication
4. **Testing Strategy**: Develop comprehensive test plan
5. **Documentation**: Update README with authentication setup instructions
