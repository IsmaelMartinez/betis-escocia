# Product Requirements Document: Storybook Integration

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the integration of Storybook into the Betis supporters club website to improve developer experience and component development workflow. Storybook will serve as an isolated development environment for React components, enabling faster iteration, better component documentation, and enhanced design-development collaboration.

The primary goal is to establish a robust component development workflow that supports the mobile-first, Betis-branded design system while improving code quality and reducing component-related bugs.

## Goals

1. **Improve Developer Experience**: Reduce component development time by 30% through isolated component development
2. **Establish Design Consistency**: Create a centralized location to document and maintain Betis branding standards (green/gold colors, mobile-first patterns)
3. **Enhance Component Reusability**: Increase component reuse across the application by providing clear usage examples
4. **Streamline Development Workflow**: Enable local development of components without running the full Next.js application
5. **Reduce Component-Related Bugs**: Improve component quality through isolated testing and documentation

## User Stories

1. **As a frontend developer**, I want to develop components in isolation so that I can iterate quickly without dependencies on the full application context.

2. **As a frontend developer**, I want to see all available component states and variations in one place so that I can understand component capabilities and choose the right implementation.

3. **As a team member**, I want to view component documentation with usage examples so that I can implement components correctly and consistently.

4. **As a developer**, I want to test component behavior with different props so that I can ensure components work correctly across all use cases.

5. **As a new team member**, I want to browse existing components and their documentation so that I can understand the codebase and design patterns quickly.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Storybook Setup**: The system must install and configure Storybook 9.x compatible with Next.js 15 and TypeScript.

2. **Component Coverage**: The system must include stories for reusable UI components, starting with a subset and expanding gradually to cover all components in `src/components/`.

3. **Interactive Controls**: The system must provide interactive controls (Storybook Controls addon) for component props to enable real-time testing of different component states.

4. **Documentation Integration**: The system must support MDX documentation pages for comprehensive component documentation with usage examples.

5. **Visual Regression Testing**: The system must integrate with visual testing tools to catch unintended UI changes.

6. **Accessibility Testing**: The system must include accessibility testing add-ons (a11y addon) to ensure components meet accessibility standards.

7. **Local Development**: The system must run locally alongside the Next.js development server without conflicts.

8. **Betis Branding Integration**: The system must reflect and document Betis branding guidelines including:
   - Primary colors: Green (#00A651) and gold accents
   - Mobile-first responsive patterns
   - Typography and spacing standards
   - Component state variations

9. **TypeScript Integration**: The system must fully support TypeScript with automatic prop type inference and documentation.

10. **Build Integration**: The system must integrate with the existing build process and development workflow.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Full Design System Implementation**: This integration will not create a comprehensive design system from scratch, but will document existing patterns.

2. **Automated Component Generation**: Will not include tools for automatically generating components from Storybook stories.

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Visual regression testing will focus on modern browsers, not comprehensive cross-browser compatibility testing.

4. **Performance Testing**: Component performance benchmarking is outside the scope of this integration.

5. **External Design Tool Integration**: Integration with Figma or other design tools is not included in this phase.

## Design Considerations

### Storybook Configuration
- **Webpack Integration**: Configure Storybook to work with Next.js webpack configuration
- **Tailwind CSS Support**: Ensure Tailwind classes work correctly in Storybook environment
- **Asset Handling**: Configure proper handling of images and static assets from `public/` directory

### Component Organization
- **Story Structure**: Organize stories by component type (UI, Forms, Layout, Feature-specific)
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent naming for stories and controls
- **Documentation Standards**: Establish templates for component documentation

### Visual Design
- **Storybook Theme**: Customize Storybook UI to reflect Betis branding where appropriate
- **Viewport Configuration**: Configure mobile-first viewports for responsive testing
- **Background Options**: Provide Betis-branded background options for component testing

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Storybook Core**: Latest stable version (9.x) compatible with Next.js 15
- **Required Addons**: Latest versions of Controls, Docs, A11y, Viewport, Backgrounds addons
- **Next.js Integration**: Ensure compatibility with App Router and TypeScript using latest Storybook frameworks

### Build Process
- **Development Scripts**: Add `npm run storybook` command for local development
- **Build Scripts**: Add `npm run build-storybook` for static build generation
- **CI/CD Integration**: Consider future integration with GitHub Actions for automated builds

### File Structure
```
.storybook/
├── main.ts          # Storybook configuration
├── preview.ts       # Global parameters and decorators
└── theme.ts         # Custom Storybook theme

src/components/
├── Button/
│   ├── Button.tsx
│   ├── Button.stories.tsx
│   └── Button.mdx
```

### Feature Flag Integration
- **Storybook Access**: Consider using Flagsmith to control Storybook access in different environments
- **Component Feature Flags**: Document how components interact with feature flags

## Success Metrics

1. **Development Efficiency**: Measure 30% reduction in component development time through developer surveys
2. **Component Reuse**: Track increase in component reuse across the application (baseline to be established)
3. **Bug Reduction**: Monitor 25% reduction in component-related bugs reported in production
4. **Documentation Usage**: Track Storybook page views and developer engagement with component documentation
5. **Onboarding Improvement**: Measure new developer onboarding time reduction through access to component documentation

## Open Questions

1. **Deployment Strategy**: Should Storybook be deployed as a static site for team access, or remain local-only initially?

2. **Component Priority**: Which specific components should be prioritized for the initial Storybook implementation?

3. **Visual Testing Integration**: Which visual regression testing tool should be integrated (Chromatic, Percy, or alternatives)?

4. **Design Token Integration**: How should existing Tailwind CSS classes be documented and organized within Storybook?

5. **Authentication Components**: How should Clerk-dependent components be handled in Storybook's isolated environment?

6. **Feature Flag Testing**: How should components that depend on Flagsmith feature flags be demonstrated in Storybook?
