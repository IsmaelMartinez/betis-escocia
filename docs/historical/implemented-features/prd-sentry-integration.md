# Product Requirements Document: Sentry Integration for Enhanced Error Monitoring

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Sentry, an error tracking and performance monitoring platform, into the Real Betis Supporters Club website. The primary goal is to enhance our ability to detect, diagnose, and resolve production issues proactively, thereby improving application stability and user experience. This integration will prioritize features available within Sentry's free tier or open-source self-hosted options to ensure cost-effectiveness.

## 2. Goals

*   **Proactive Error Detection:** Automatically capture and report all unhandled exceptions, network errors, and other critical issues across the application stack.
*   **Accelerated Debugging:** Provide comprehensive context (stack traces, user data, environment details, breadcrumbs) to facilitate rapid identification and resolution of bugs.
*   **Performance Insight:** Monitor key performance metrics and identify bottlenecks affecting user experience.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Reduce downtime and user-facing errors by enabling faster incident response.
*   **Release Health Monitoring:** Track the health and stability of new deployments.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a Developer,** I want to receive immediate notifications of new errors in production so that I can quickly identify and fix critical bugs.
*   **As a Developer,** I want to see detailed stack traces, user context, and request data for each error so that I can efficiently debug and understand the root cause.
*   **As a Support Team Member,** I want to easily search for specific user errors reported by customers so that I can provide accurate and timely assistance.
*   **As a Product Manager,** I want to view dashboards showing application error rates and performance trends so that I can assess overall application health and prioritize improvements.
*   **As a Release Manager,** I want to monitor the health of new deployments in real-time so that I can quickly identify and roll back problematic releases if necessary.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system must automatically capture and report unhandled JavaScript exceptions from the frontend.
2.  The system must automatically capture and report unhandled exceptions from Next.js API routes (backend).
3.  The system must capture and report network request failures.
4.  The system must associate errors with authenticated Clerk user IDs.
5.  The system must include browser, OS, and device information with each error report.
6.  The system must include request details (URL, method, headers, sanitized body) for backend errors.
7.  The system must provide breadcrumbs (a trail of events) leading up to an error.
8.  The system must track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) for performance monitoring.
9.  The system must allow for custom transaction tracing for critical user flows.
10. The system must automatically tag errors with the current application version/release.
11. The system must support uploading source maps for readable stack traces.
12. The system must differentiate errors by environment (development, staging, production).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   Advanced custom data retention policies beyond the free tier limits.
*   Complex custom alerting rules requiring paid Sentry features.
*   Deep integration with third-party issue trackers (e.g., Jira) beyond basic linking.
*   Comprehensive security monitoring or vulnerability scanning (focus is on application errors).
*   Real-time user session replays.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   Utilize `@sentry/nextjs` SDK for seamless integration with Next.js.
*   Implement Sentry Error Boundaries for robust React component error handling.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   Configure Sentry DSN and other settings via environment variables (`.env.local`, Vercel environment variables).
*   Ensure proper data sanitization to prevent sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) from being sent to Sentry.
*   Consider the implications of Sentry's free tier limits on data volume and retention, and plan for potential future scaling if needed.
*   Integrate Sentry's user context feature with Clerk to associate errors with specific users.
*   Implement release tracking by setting the `release` option in Sentry configuration, ideally tied to CI/CD pipelines.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   **95% of unhandled production errors** are automatically captured and reported in Sentry.
*   **Average time to resolve critical bugs** is reduced by 20% within three months of full Sentry integration.
*   **All new deployments** have associated release health data in Sentry.
*   **Key performance metrics** (e.g., Web Vitals) are consistently monitored and actionable insights are derived from Sentry's performance dashboards.
*   **Developers can easily access relevant context** (user, stack trace, breadcrumbs) for reported errors.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What is the preferred method for managing Sentry DSNs across different environments (e.g., Vercel environment variables, `.env.local`)?
*   Are there any specific sensitive data fields that *must* be scrubbed or excluded from Sentry payloads?
*   What is the desired notification mechanism for critical errors (e.g., Slack, email, PagerDuty)? (This might be configured directly in Sentry, but good to confirm expectations).
