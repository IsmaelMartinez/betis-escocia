# PRD: Trivia System Simplification

## Introduction/Overview

The current trivia system is significantly over-engineered for a daily quiz feature, with 10+ state variables, 3 API endpoints, complex game flow logic, and excessive frontend/backend complexity. This creates maintenance burden, slows development, impacts performance, and makes the user experience unnecessarily complicated.

This PRD outlines an aggressive simplification of the trivia system that reduces complexity by ~60% while maintaining all current functionality and improving user experience. The goal is to transform an over-engineered system into a clean, maintainable, performant daily quiz that delivers the same user value with dramatically less code.

## Goals

1. **Reduce System Complexity**: Decrease codebase from ~400 lines to ~150 lines (60% reduction)
2. **Improve Performance**: Reduce initial API calls from 2-3 to 1, faster load times
3. **Enhance Maintainability**: Simplify state management from 10+ variables to 3 core states
4. **Accelerate Development**: Make adding new trivia features 3x faster
5. **Preserve User Experience**: Maintain all current functionality with zero downtime
6. **Improve Code Quality**: Eliminate redundant logic and complex state transitions

## User Stories

- Add new trivia categories or modify gameplay easily

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: Backend Consolidation (Week 1)

1. **Consolidate API Endpoints**: Replace 3 endpoints (`/api/trivia`, `/api/trivia/total-score`, `/api/trivia/total-score-dashboard`) with single endpoint using query parameters
2. **Simplify Database Operations**: Maintain current 3-table structure but eliminate redundant queries and complex joins
3. **Streamline Daily Play Logic**: Consolidate duplicate daily-play-check logic into single reusable function
4. **Preserve All Current Features**: Zero functionality regression - all current trivia features must work identically
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing frontend must continue working during Phase 1

### Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring (Week 2)  

6. **State Management Simplification**: Reduce from 10+ state variables to 3 core states (`gameState`, `currentData`, `error`)
7. **Component Consolidation**: Remove `TriviaScoreDisplay` component, inline score display in main component
8. **Timer Simplification**: Replace complex `GameTimer` component with simple `setTimeout`-based countdown
9. **Game Flow Streamlining**: Eliminate complex state transitions while preserving visual feedback
10. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure simplified system performs better on mobile devices

### Cross-Phase Requirements

11. **Zero Downtime Migration**: Users must be able to play trivia throughout the entire simplification process
12. **Data Preservation**: All existing user scores and trivia content must be preserved
13. **Performance Improvement**: Page load time must improve by at least 25%
14. **Test Coverage Maintenance**: All existing tests must pass, with simplified tests added for new code
15. **Documentation Updates**: Update all relevant documentation to reflect simplified architecture

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **New Trivia Features**: No new gameplay mechanics, question types, or user-facing features
2. **UI/UX Changes**: Visual design and user interface remain unchanged
3. **Database Schema Changes**: No table structure modifications in Phase 1
4. **Authentication Changes**: No modifications to user authentication or authorization
5. **Analytics Enhancement**: No new tracking or metrics collection (existing analytics preserved)
6. **Mobile App Development**: Web-only simplification, no native mobile app considerations
7. **Multilingual Support**: No localization or translation features
8. **Admin Interface**: No content management system for trivia questions
9. **Social Features**: No sharing, leaderboards, or social integration
10. **External API Integration**: No third-party trivia services or APIs

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Simplification
- **State Machine Pattern**: Implement simple `idle → playing → completed` state transitions
- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminate duplicate state across components
- **Declarative Rendering**: Remove complex conditional rendering logic
- **Error Boundaries**: Maintain robust error handling with simpler implementation

### User Interface Preservation
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintain exact same look, feel, and branding
- **Interaction Patterns**: Preserve current button interactions, feedback, and animations  
- **Responsive Design**: Keep existing mobile-first approach and breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Maintain current ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Performance Optimization
- **API Efficiency**: Single request for complete game data
- **State Updates**: Minimize re-renders through optimized state structure
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce JavaScript payload by removing unused components
- **Caching Strategy**: Preserve existing caching without adding complexity

## Technical Considerations

### Phase 1 Implementation
- **API Consolidation**: Use query parameters (`?action=questions|submit|score`) for single endpoint
- **Database Optimization**: Eliminate redundant queries while maintaining current schema
- **Backward Compatibility**: Implement adapter pattern for existing frontend during transition
- **Migration Safety**: Use feature flags to enable/disable new backend incrementally

### Phase 2 Implementation  
- **State Refactoring**: Implement reducer pattern for simplified state management
- **Component Removal**: Safely remove `GameTimer` and `TriviaScoreDisplay` components
- **Testing Strategy**: Update existing tests and add new ones for simplified components
- **Performance Validation**: Implement monitoring to verify performance improvements

### Dependencies
- **Existing Stack**: Continue using Next.js, Supabase, Clerk authentication
- **No New Dependencies**: Achieve simplification through reduction, not addition
- **Feature Flag Integration**: Leverage existing feature flag system for safe deployment
- **Test Infrastructure**: Use existing Vitest/Playwright setup for validation
