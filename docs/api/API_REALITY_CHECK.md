# API Reality Check: Football Data APIs Assessment

**Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Project**: Pe√±a B√©tica Escocesa Website - Real Betis Match Integration

## ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**

### API-Football Free Tier Limitation
- **Data Range**: Only 2021-2023 seasons available on free tier
- **Current Season**: 2024-25 (recently ended) and 2025-26 (upcoming)
- **Problem**: 2+ year old data is **USELESS** for a current football website

## üîç **Revised API Evaluation**

### Football-Data.org (Our Current Setup)
**‚úÖ PROS:**
- **FREE FOREVER** for top competitions including La Liga
- **CURRENT DATA** - provides real-time and recent match data
- **10 requests/minute** = 14,400 requests/day (very generous)
- **Reliable and maintained** since 2014

**‚ùå CONS:**
- **Limited detail**: Basic fixtures, results, standings only
- **No player statistics**: No lineups, individual player data
- **No match events**: No goal details, cards, substitutions
- **No advanced stats**: No possession, shots, pass completion

### API-Football (RapidAPI)
**‚úÖ PROS:**
- **Comprehensive data**: Player stats, lineups, events, detailed statistics
- **Professional quality**: Much richer data than Football-Data.org

**‚ùå CONS (CRITICAL):**
- **OUTDATED DATA**: Free tier only has 2021-2023 seasons
- **Useless for current website**: Fans want recent matches, not 2+ year old data
- **Paid tiers expensive**: Current season data requires paid subscription

## üéØ **RECOMMENDATION: Stick with Football-Data.org**

1. **CURRENT DATA** ‚úÖ
