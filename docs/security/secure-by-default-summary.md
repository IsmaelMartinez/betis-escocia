# Secure-by-Default Feature Flags - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Secure-by-Default Feature Flags System with Flagsmith

### 🔒 Security Principle Implemented
**ALL features are now managed by Flagsmith and are disabled by default unless explicitly enabled in the Flagsmith dashboard.** This ensures no accidental feature exposure in production environments.

Additionally, **Row Level Security (RLS) is implemented on sensitive database tables** (e.g., `user_trivia_scores`) to ensure users can only access and modify their own data, even if a feature flag is enabled.

### 📋 What Changed

#### 1. Migrated to Flagsmith
- **Before**: Environment variable-based feature flags (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_*`).
- **After**: All feature flags are managed in Flagsmith. The `lib/featureFlags.ts` and related files have been removed.
- **Implementation**: The core logic is now in `src/lib/flagsmith/index.ts`.

#### 2. Updated Documentation (`/docs/feature-flags.md`)
- **Emphasis on "Flagsmith-Managed"** principle.
- Clear instructions on how to manage features in the Flagsmith dashboard.
- Updated development setup to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT_ID`.

### 🎯 Current Behavior

#### Default State (No Flagsmith Configuration)
- **Result**: The application will fail to load features correctly. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT_ID` is required.

#### With Flagsmith Configured
- **Result**: Feature visibility is determined by the settings in the corresponding Flagsmith environment.

### 🛡️ Security Benefits

1.  **No Accidental Exposure**: Features can't be accidentally enabled in production.
2.  **Explicit Control**: Every feature requires a deliberate action in the Flagsmith dashboard to enable it.
3.  **Environment Isolation**: Easy to have different feature sets per environment (dev, staging, prod) using different Flagsmith environments.
4.  **Real-time Control**: Features can be enabled or disabled instantly without a new deployment.

### ⚡ Breaking Changes

**IMPORTANT**: The entire feature flag system has been migrated. Environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_*`) are no longer used.

**Migration**: All feature flag control is now in the Flagsmith dashboard.

### 🧪 Testing Validation

- ✅ With a valid `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, features are enabled/disabled based on the Flagsmith dashboard settings.
- ✅ Navigation renders correctly based on feature flags.
- ✅ Route protection works (404 for disabled features).

### 🚀 Next Steps

The feature flag system is now complete and secure. Future enhancements could include:

- **A/B Testing**: Percentage-based rollouts using Flagsmith's features.
- **User Segmentation**: Different features for different user groups, also a Flagsmith feature.

### 📁 Files Modified

- `src/lib/flagsmith/index.ts` - Core feature flag logic.
- `src/lib/flagsmith/config.ts` - Flagsmith configuration.
- `src/lib/flagsmith/types.ts` - Types for the Flagsmith integration.
- `docs/feature-flags.md` - Documentation updated.
- All files that previously used the old feature flag system.

## 🎉 Mission Accomplished

The feature flag system now follows the **secure-by-default principle** using a centralized and dynamic management tool (Flagsmith). No features will be accidentally exposed, and every feature requires an explicit decision to enable it.
