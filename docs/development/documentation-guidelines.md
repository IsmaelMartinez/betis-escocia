# Documentation Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish a uniform standard for documentation across the Peña Bética Escocesa project. Consistent documentation ensures clarity, uniformity, and efficiency for both current and future team members.

## General Guidelines

1. **Clarity**: Write clear and concise documentation. Avoid jargon and ensure that the document is understandable by a junior developer.
2. **Format**: Use Markdown for all documentation files. Follow consistent formatting such as headings, lists, and code blocks.
3. **Version Control**: Ensure all documentation is kept up to date with code changes. Use version control to track historical changes.
4. **Structure**: Organize documentation into relevant directories, such as `/docs`, `/tasks`, etc.
5. **Links**: Use relative links for referencing other documents within the repository.
